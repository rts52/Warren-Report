      <div class="text">serve until<span class="date">December 8, 1962</span>.458 He was assigned to the Marine Air Reserve Training Command at the Naval Air Station
         in Glenview, Ill.459</div>
      <div class="text">Almost exactly 1 year later, on<span class="date">September 13, 1960</span>,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was given an "undesirable discharge" from the Marine Corps Reserve,460 based on:</div>
      <div class="text">reliable information which indicated that he had renounced his U.S. citizenship with
         the intentions of becoming a permanent citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
         Further, that petitioner brought discredit to the Marine Corps through adverse newspaper
         publicity, which was generated by the foregoing action, and had thereby, in the opinion
         of his commanding officer, proved himself unfit for retention in the naval service.461</div>
      <div class="text">SOVIET UNION</div>
      <div class="text">On September 4, the day on which he was transferred out of MACS-9 in preparation for
         his discharge,<span class="person">Oswald</span>had applied for a passport at the Superior Court of Santa Ana, Calif. His application
         stated that he planned to leave the United States on September 21 to attend the Albert
         Schweitzer College and the University of Turku in Finland, and to travel in Cuba,
         the Dominican Republic, England, France Germany, and Russia.462 The passport was routinely
         issued 6 days later.463</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>went directly home after his discharge, and arrived in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>by September 14.464 He told his mother that he intended to get a job on a ship or
         possibly in the "export-import business." 465 If he stayed in Fort Worth, he said,
         he would be able to earn only about $30 per week; on a ship, he would earn "big money"
         and be able to send substantial amounts home.466 Three days after he arrived in Fort
         Worth, he left for New Orleans.467 While he was in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>he had registered his dependency discharge and entry into the Marine Reserve at the<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>Selective Service Board,468 and visited his brother<span class="person">Robert</span>and his family.469 He also gave his mother $100.470</div>
      <div class="text">On September 17,<span class="person">Oswald</span>spoke with a representative of Travel Consultants, Inc., a<span class="place">New Orleans</span>travel bureau; he filled out a "Passenger Immigration Questionnaire," on which he
         gave his occupation as "shipping export agent" and said that he would be abroad for
         2 months on a pleasure trip. He booked passage from<span class="place">New Orleans</span>to Le Havre, France, on a freighter, the SS Marion Lykes, scheduled to sail on September
         18, for which he paid $220.75.471 On the evening of September 17, he registered at
         the Liberty Hotel.472</div>
      <div class="text">The Marion Lykes did not sail until the early morning of September 20.473 Before its
         departure,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote his mother a letter, which was her last news of him until she read stories of
         his defection in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>newspapers:</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 690 - Page 690</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">Dear Mother:</div>
      <div class="text">Well, I have booked passage on a ship to Europe, I would of had to sooner or later
         and I think it's best I go now. Just remember above all else that my values are very
         different from<span class="person">Robert</span>'s or your's. It is difficult to tell you how I feel, Just remember this is what I
         must do. I did not tell you about my plans because you could harly be expected to
         understand.</div>
      <div class="text">I did not see aunt Lilian while I was here. I will write again as soon as I land.</div>
      <div class="text">Lee 474</div>
      <div class="text">The Marion Lykes carried only four passengers.475<span class="person">Oswald</span>shared his cabin with Billy Joe Lord, a young man who had just graduated from high
         school and was going to France to continue his education. Lord testified that he and<span class="person">Oswald</span>did not discuss politics but did have a few amicable religious arguments, in which<span class="person">Oswald</span>defended atheism.<span class="person">Oswald</span>was "standoffish," but told Lord generally about his background, mentioning that his
         mother worked in a drugstore in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>and that he was bitter about the low wages which she received. He told Lord that he
         intended to travel in Europe and possibly to attend school in Sweden or Switzerland
         if he had sufficient funds.476 The other two passengers were Lt. Col. and Mrs. George
         B. Church, Jr., who also found<span class="person">Oswald</span>unfriendly and had little contact with him.<span class="person">Oswald</span>told them that he had not liked the Marine Corps and that he planned to study in Switzerland;
         they observed some "bitterness" about his mother's difficulties, but did not discuss
         this with him. No one on board suspected that he intended to defect to Russia.477</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>disembarked at<span class="place">Le Havre</span>on October 8. He left for England that same day, and arrived on October 9.478 He told
         English customs officials in<span class="place">Southampton</span>that he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for 1 week before proceeding
         to a school in Switzerland. But on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, Finland, where
         he registered at the Torni Hotel; on the following day, he moved to the Klaus Kurki
         Hotel.479</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>probably applied for a visa at the Russian consulate on October 12, his first business
         day in Helsinki.480 The visa was issued on October 14. It was valid until October
         20 and permitted him to take one trip of not more than 6 days to the Soviet Union.481
         He also purchased 10 Soviet "tourist vouchers" which cost $30 apiece.482 He left<span class="place">Helsinki</span>by train on the following day, crossed the Finnish-Russian border at Vainikkala, and
         arrived in<span class="place">Moscow</span>on October 16.483</div>
      <div class="text">He was met at the<span class="place">Moscow</span>railroad station by a representative of "Intourist," the state tourist agency, and
         taken to the Hotel Berlin, where he registered as a student.484 On the same day he
         met the Intourist guide assigned to him during his stay in Russia, a young woman named<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>. They went sightseeing the next day. Almost immediately he told her that he wanted
         to leave</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 691 - Page 691</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">the United States and become a citizen of the Soviet Union. According to<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s "Historic Diary," she later told him that she had reported his statement to Intourist
         headquarters, which in turn had notified the "Passport and Visa Office" (probably
         the Visa and Registration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the MVD
         485). She was instructed to help<span class="person">Oswald</span>prepare a letter to the Supreme Soviet requesting that he be granted citizenship.<span class="person">Oswald</span>mailed such a letter that same day.486 (The "Historic Diary" is<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s handwritten account of his life in Russia.487 The earlier entries were written
         after the events which they describe; later, in Minsk, he probably kept a contemporaneous
         record of his experiences. 488 The Commission has used the diary, which<span class="person">Oswald</span>may have written with future readers in mind, only as<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s record of his private life and personal impressions as he sought to present them
         and has relied wherever possible on official documents, correspondence, and the testimony
         of witnesses.)</div>
      <div class="text">The diary records that when<span class="person">Oswald</span>told<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>that he intended to defect she was "flabbergassted," but agreed to help.489 She was
         "politly sympathetic but uneasy" when he told her that he wanted to defect because
         he was "a Communist, ect." 490 As an Intourist guide,<span class="person">Rima</span>toured parts of<span class="place">Moscow</span>with<span class="person">Oswald</span>in the next few days. His primary concern, however, appeared to be his effort to become
         a Soviet citizen, and she also aided him in his dealings with the Soviet Government.491
         He thought that<span class="person">Rima</span>felt sorry for him and tried to be a friend because he was "someth. new." 492 On his
         20th birthday, 2 days after he arrived in Russia, she gave him Dostoevski's "The Idiot,"
         493 in which she had written: "Dear Lee, Great congratulations! Let all your dreams
         come true! 18.X 1959" 494</div>
      <div class="text">On October 19,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was probably interviewed in his hotel room by a man named Lev Setyayev, who said that
         he was a reporter for Radio<span class="place">Moscow</span>seeking statements from American tourists about their impressions of Moscow,495 but
         who was probably also acting for the KGB.496 Two years later,<span class="person">Oswald</span>told officials at the American Embassy that he had made a few routine comments to
         Setyayev of no political signifiance. The interview with Setyayev may, however, have
         been the occasion for an attempt by the KGB, in accordance with regular practice,
         to assess<span class="person">Oswald</span>or even to elicit compromising statements from him; the interview was apparently never
         broadcast.497 (As discussed in ch. VI of this report, the Commission is aware that
         many of the Soviet officials with whom<span class="person">Oswald</span>came into contact were employees of the KGB, the agency which has primary jurisdiction
         for the treatment of defectors.)</div>
      <div class="text">On the following day,<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>told him that the "Pass. and Visa Dept." wanted to see him,498 and on the morning
         of October 21, he was interviewed by an official concerning his application for citizenship.
         The official offered little information and no encouragement; he told<span class="person">Oswald</span>only that he would check to see if the visa could</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 692 - Page 692</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">be extended.<span class="person">Oswald</span>returned to the Hotel Berlin.499 That afternoon, he was notified that his visa had
         expired and that he had to leave<span class="place">Moscow</span>within 2 hours.500</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>responded to the unfavorable decision by cutting himself above his left, wrist, in
         an apparent suicide attempt.<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>found him unconscious in his hotel room and had him taken to the Botkinskaya Hospital.
         His diary states: "Poor Rimmea stays by my side as interrpator (my Russian is still
         very bad) far into the night, I tell her 'Go home' (my mood is bad) but she stays,
         she is 'my friend.'" 501</div>
      <div class="text">For 3 days<span class="person">Oswald</span>was confined in the psychiatric ward of the hospital. He was examined by a psychiatrist,
         who concluded that he was not dangerous to other people and could be transferred to
         the "somatic" department. Hospital records containing the results of the examination
         502 state that<span class="person">Oswald</span>came to Russia in order to apply for citizenship, and that "in order to postpone his
         departure he inflicted the injury upon himself." 503 They note that<span class="person">Oswald</span>understood some Russian and, presumably based on information which he provided, that
         he had "graduated from a technical high school in radio technology and radio electronics."
         504 The record states: "He claims he regrets his action. After recovering he intends
         to return to his homeland." 505</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>resented being in the psychiatric ward and told<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>that he wanted a transfer.506 She visited him at the hospital frequently and his diary
         records that "only at this moment" did he "notice [that] she is preety." 507 Another
         entry for the hospital period says: "Afternoon I am visited by Roza Agafonova of the
         hotel tourist office, who askes about my health, very beautiful, excelant Eng., very
         merry and kind, she makes me very glad to be alive." 508 These entries reflect an
         attitude gentler and friendlier than his attitude before the suicide attempt, when
         he seemed to be coldly concerned only with his status in Russia. Once<span class="person">Oswald</span>was out of the psychiatric ward, he found the hospital more pleasant. The new ward,
         which he shared with 11 other patients, was "airy," and the food was good. His only
         complaint, according to his diary, was that an "elderly American" patient was distrustful
         of him because he had not registered at the American Embassy and because he was evasive
         about the reasons for his presence in<span class="place">Moscow</span>and confinement in the hospital.509</div>
      <div class="text">He was released from the hospital on October 28,510 and, accompanied by<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>, was driven to the<span class="place">Hotel Berlin</span>in an Intourist car. After he said goodby to Lyudmila Dmitrieva, head of the In-tourist
         office at the Berlin, and to Roza Agafonova, another Intourist employee at the hotel,
         he checked out of the Berlin and registered at the Metropole, 511 a large hotel under
         the same administration as the Berlin.512 The Government had undoubtedly directed
         him to make the change. His visa had expired while he was in the hospital, and his
         presence in Russia was technically illegal; he had received no word that the decision
         that he must leave had been reversed. Later that day, however,<span class="person">Rima</span>told him that the "Pass and Registration Office" wished</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 693 - Page 693</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">to talk to him about his future.513 According to the diary, when<span class="person">Oswald</span>appeared at the office he was asked whether he still wanted to become a Soviet citizen
         and he replied that he did; he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers for identification.
         He was told that he could not expect a decision soon, and was dismissed. During this
         interview,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was apparently questioned about the interview which preceded his hospitalization,
         which led him to conclude that there had been no communication between the two sets
         of officials.514 That evening he met<span class="person">Rima</span>, on whom he vented his frustration at being put off by the authorities.515</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>ate only once on the following day; he stayed near the telephone, fully dressed and
         ready to leave immediately if he were summoned. He remained in his room for 3 days,
         which seemed to him "like three years," 516 until October 31, when he decided to act.
         He met<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>at noon and told her that he was impatient, but did not say what he planned to do;
         she cautioned him to stay in his room "and eat well." 517 She left him after a short
         while and, a few minutes later, he took a taxi to the American Embassy, where he asked
         to see the consul. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 24, 912, 913, pp. 264, 263, 261.)
         When the receptionist asked him first to sign the tourist register, he laid his passport
         on the desk and said that he had come to "dissolve his American citizenship." Richard
         E.<span class="person">Snyder</span>, the Second Secretary and senior consular official,518 was summoned, and he invited<span class="person">Oswald</span>into his office.519</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>'s meeting with<span class="person">Snyder</span>, at which<span class="person">Snyder</span>'s assistant, John A. McVickar, was also present, is more fully discussed in appendix
         XV to the Commission's report.<span class="person">Oswald</span>declared that he wanted to renounce his American citizenship; he denounced the United
         States and praised the Government of the Soviet Union. Over<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s objections,<span class="person">Snyder</span>sought to learn something of<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s motives and background and to forestall immediate action.<span class="person">Oswald</span>told him that he had already offered to tell a Soviet official what he had learned
         as a radar operator in the Marines. The interview ended when<span class="person">Snyder</span>told<span class="person">Oswald</span>that he could renounce his citizenship on the following Monday, 2 days later, if he
         would appear personally to do so. During the interview,<span class="person">Oswald</span>handed to<span class="person">Snyder</span>a note 520 which suggests that he had studied and sought to comply with section 349
         of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides for loss of American citizenship.521
         The note contains paragraphs which read like inartistic attempts to cast off citizenship
         in three of the ways specified by the statute. The attempts failed but there is no
         reason to doubt that they were sincere.<span class="person">Snyder</span>has testified that he believed that<span class="person">Oswald</span>would immediately have formally renounced his citizenship had he been permitted to
         do so.522</div>
      <div class="text">The interview lasted for less than an hour.<span class="person">Oswald</span>returned to his hotel angry about the delay but "elated" by the "showdown" and sure
         that he would be permitted to remain after his "sign of ... faith" in the Russians.523
         Soon after he returned to the hotel, he was</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 694 - Page 694</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">approached by A. I. Goldberg, a reporter for the Associated Press, whom the Embassy
         had told about<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s actions.<span class="person">Oswald</span>refused to speak to him.524 He answered a few questions for two other reporters, R.
         J. Korengold and Miss<span class="person">Aline Mosby</span>, but again refused to be interviewed.525 Thereafter, the news services made repeated
         unsuccessful attempts to interview him, which he thought was an indirect form of pressure
         from the Embassy to return to the United States.526</div>
      <div class="text">On the day after<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s meeting with<span class="person">Snyder</span>, his family read in the newspapers about his appearance at the Embassy and tried
         to contact him. Mrs.<span class="person">Oswald</span>testified that she was shocked at her son's decision to defect but, respected his
         motives for doing so; later she suspected that he had been forcibly removed to Russia.527
         She placed a telephone call to him,528 but he either refused to speak to her 529 or
         cut her off very quickly.530 So too, on November 2, he rejected the Embassy's efforts
         to deliver or read on the telephone a telegram from his brother<span class="person">Robert</span>.531 A call from<span class="person">Robert</span>was either canceled before it was completed or was refused.532<span class="person">Robert</span>'s telegram, along with a message asking<span class="person">Oswald</span>to contact, him immediately, which<span class="person">Robert</span>had asked the State Department to deliver,533 was finally sent to<span class="person">Oswald</span>from the Embassy by registered mail.534</div>
      <div class="text">A few days later, the Embassy received a letter from<span class="person">Oswald</span>dated November 3 which requested that his citizenship be revoked.535 The letter stated
         that he had appeared at the Embassy "for the purpose of signing the formal papers
         to this effect" and protested against the "conduct of the official" who had refused
         him "this legal right."<span class="person">Oswald</span>noted that his application for Soviet citizenship was pending and said that if it
         were granted he would ask the Soviet Government "to lodge a formal protest" on his
         behalf.536 The Embassy replied on November 9 that<span class="person">Oswald</span>could renounce his citizenship by appearing at the Embassy and executing the necessary
         papers.537</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>'s diary describes the period from November 2 to November 15, during which he continued
         to isolate himself, as "days of utter loneliness." 538 On November 8, he wrote to
         his brother:</div>
      <div class="text">Dear<span class="person">Robert</span></div>
      <div class="text">Well, what shall we talk about, the weather perhaps? Certainly you do not wish me
         to speak of my decision to remain in the Soviet Union and apply for citizenship here,
         since I'm afraid you would not be able to comprehend my reasons. You really dent know
         anything about me. Do you know for instance that I have waited to do this for well
         over a year, do you know that I ... [phrase in Russian] speak a fair amount of Russian
         which I have been studing for many months.</div>
      <div class="text">I have been told that I will not have to leave the Soviet Union if I do not care to.
         this than is my decision. I will not leave this country, the Soviet Union, under any
         conditions, I will never return to the United States which is a country I hate.</div>
      <div class="text">Someday, perhaps soon, and than again perhaps in a few years, I will become a citizen
         of the Soviet Union, but it is a very legal</div>

      <div class="text">I recived your telegram and was glad to hear from you, only one word bothered me,
         the word "mistake." I assume you mean that I have made a "mistake" it is not for you
         to tell me that you cannot understand my reasons for this very action.</div>
      <div class="text">I will not speak to anyone from the United States over the telephone since it may
         be taped by the Americans.</div>
      <div class="text">If you wish to corespond with me you can write to the below address, but I really
         don't, see what we could take about if you want to send me money, that I can us, but
         I do not expect to be able to send it back.</div>
      <div class="text">LEE 589</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>'s statement that he had been told that he could remain in Russia was not true. According
         to his diary, he was not told until later that he could remain even temporarily in
         Russia,540 and only in January was he told the he could remain indefinitely.541 The
         Embassy tried to deliver a typed copy of a telegram from his brother John on November
         9;<span class="person">Oswald</span>refused to answer the knock on his door, and the message was then sent to him by registered
         mail.542</div>
      <div class="text">Toward the end of this waiting period, probably on November 13,<span class="person">Aline Mosby</span>succeeded in interviewing<span class="person">Oswald</span>.543 A reporter for United Press International, she had called him on the telephone
         and was told to come right over,<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s explanation being that he thought she might "understand and be friendly" because
         she was a woman.544 She was the first person who was not a Soviet citizen to whom
         he granted an interview since his meeting with<span class="person">Snyder</span>at the Embassy on October 31. Miss<span class="person">Mosby</span>found him polite but stiff; she said that be seemed full of confidence, often showing
         a "small smile, more like a smirk," and that he talked almost "non-stop."<span class="person">Oswald</span>said to her that he had been told that he could remain in the Soviet Union and that
         job possibilities were being explored; they thought it probably would be best, he
         said, to continue his education. He admitted that his Russian was bad but was confident
         that it would improve rapidly. He based his dislike for the United States on his observations
         of racial prejudice and the contrast between "the luxuries of Park Avenue and workers'
         lives on the East Side," and mentioned his mother's poverty; he said that if he had
         remained in the United States he too would have become either a capitalist or a worker.
         "One way or another." he said, "I'd lose in the United States. In my own mind, even
         if I'd be exploiting other workers. That's why I chose Marxist ideology."</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>told his interviewer that he had been interested in Communist theory since he was
         15, when "an old lady" in New York handed him "a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs."
         But when<span class="person">Mosby</span>asked if he were a member of the Communist Party he said that he had never met a Communist
         and that he "might bare seen" one only once, when he saw that "old lady." He told
         her that while</div>

      <div class="text">he was in the Marine Corps he had seen American imperialism in action, and had saved
         $1,500 in secret preparation for his defection to Russia. His only apparent regrets
         concerned his family: his mother, whom he had not told of his plans, and his brother,
         who might lose his job as a result of the publicity.545</div>
      <div class="text">The interview lasted for about 2 hours. According to<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s own account, he exacted a promise from Miss<span class="person">Mosby</span>that she would show him the story before publication but she broke the promise; he
         found the published story to contain distortions of his words.546 Miss<span class="person">Mosby</span>'s notes indicate that he called her to complain of the distortions, saying in particular
         that his family had not been "poverty-stricken" and that his defection was not prompted
         by personal hardship but that was "a matter only of ideology."</div>
      <div class="text">According to the diary,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was told in mid-November that he could remain temporarily in Russia "until some solution
         was found with what to do" with him. 548 Armed with this "comforting news," 549 he
         granted a second interview, again to a woman, on November 16.550 Miss Priscilla Johnson
         of the North American Newspaper Alliance knocked on the door of his room at the Metropole,
         and<span class="person">Oswald</span>agreed to come to her room at the hotel that evening. This interview lasted about
         5 hours, from 9 p.m. until about 2 in the morning. During the interview he frequently
         mentioned the fact that he would be able to remain in Russia, which gave him great
         pleasure, but he also showed disappointment about the difficulties standing in the
         way of his request for Soviet citizenship. He repeated most of the information he
         had given<span class="person">Aline Mosby</span>and again denied having been a member of the Communist Party or even ever having seen
         a Communist in the United States. When Miss Johnson asked him to specify some of the
         socialist writers whose works he had read during the past 5 years, he could name only
         Marx and Engels; the only title he could recall was "Das Kapital." They talked for
         a long while about Communist economic theory, which Miss Johnson thought was "his
         language"; she became convinced that his knowledge of the subject was very superficial.551
         He commented that the Russians treated his defection as a "legal formality," neither
         encouraging nor discouraging it.552 When she suggested that if he really wished to
         renounce his American citizenship he could do so by returning to the Embassy, he said
         that he would "never set foot in the Embassy again," since he was sure that he would
         be given the "same run-around" as before. He seemed to Miss Johnson to be avoiding
         effective renunciation, consciously or unconsciously, in order to preserve his right
         to reenter the United States.553</div>
      <div class="text">For the rest of the year,<span class="person">Oswald</span>seldom left his hotel room where he had arranged to take his meals, except perhaps
         for a few trips to museums. He spent most of his time studying Russian, hours a day"
         his diary records. The routine was broken only by another interview at the passport
         office; occasional visits from<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>; lessons in Russian from her and other Intourist guides; and a New Year's visit from
         Roza Agafonova, who gave</div>

         bitter statements against the United States.555<span class="person">Robert</span>received a third letter on December 17, in which<span class="person">Oswald</span>said that he would not write again and did not wish<span class="person">Robert</span>to write to him. The letter concluded:</div>
      <div class="text">I am starting a new life and I do not wish to have anything to do with the old life.</div>
      <div class="text">I hope you and your family will always be in good health.</div>

      <div class="text">His mother mailed him a personal check for $20 dated December 18. It was returned
         to her on January 5 with the notation that he could not "use this check, of course";
         he asked her to send him $20 in cash and added that he had little money and needed
         "the rest," presumably a reference to the $100 he had given her in September. Mrs.<span class="person">Oswald</span>later sent him a money order for about $25.557</div>
      <div class="text">On January 4,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was summoned to the Soviet Passport Office and given Identity Document for Stateless
         Persons No. 811479.558 He was told that he was being sent to Minsk,559 an industrial
         city located about 450 miles southwest of<span class="place">Moscow</span>and with a population in 1959 of about 510,000.560 His disappointment that he had
         not been granted Soviet citizenship was balanced by relief that the uncertainty was
         ended; he told<span class="person">Rima Shirokova</span>that he was happy.561 On the following day, he went to a Government agency which the
         Russians call the "Red Cross"; it gave him 5,000 rubles (about 500 new rubles, or
         $500 at the official exchange rate).562 He used 2,200 rubles to pay his hotel bill
         and 150 rubles to purchase a railroad ticket to Minsk. 563</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>arrived in Minsk on January 7. He was met at the station by two "Red Cross" workers
         who took him to the Hotel Minsk. Two Intourist employees, both of whom spoke excellent
         English, were waiting for him.564 One of them, a young woman named Roza Kuznetsova,
         became his close friend and attended his 21st birthday party in October 1960.565 (See
         Commission Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.) On the following day,<span class="person">Oswald</span>met the "Mayor," who welcomed him to Minsk, promised him a rent-free apartment, and
         warned him against "uncultured persons" who sometimes insulted foreigners.566</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>reported for work at the Belorussian Radio and Television Factory on January 13.567
         Two days earlier he had visited the factory and met Alexander Ziger, a Polish Jew
         who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938 and went to Russia in 1955. Ziger was a department
         head at the factory; he spoke English, and he and his family became good friends of<span class="person">Oswald</span>and corresponded with him after his return to the United States.568 The factory, a
         major producer of electronic parts and systems, employed about 5,000 persons.569<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s union card described him as a "metal worker"; 570<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that he fashioned parts on a lathe.571 As<span class="person">Oswald</span>later described it, the shop in</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 698 - Page 698</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">which he worked, called the "experimental shop," 572 employed 58 workers and 5 foremen.
         It was located in the middle part of the factory area in a 2-story building made of
         red brick. The workday began at 8 o'clock sharp. Work was assigned according to "pay
         levels," which were numbered from one to five plus a top "master" level. A worker
         could ask to be tested for a higher level at any time.573</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>had hoped to continue his education in Russia, and was disappointed by his assignment
         to a factory.574 His salary varied from 700 to perhaps as high as 900 rubles per month
         ($70-$90) Although high compared with the salaries of certain professional groups
         in Russia, which in some areas have not grown proportionately with the wages of factory
         workers,576 his salary was normal for his type of work.577 It was supplemented, however,
         by 700 rubles per month, which he received from the "Red Cross," and, according to<span class="person">Oswald</span>, his total income was about equal to that of the director of the factory.578 In August
         he applied for membership in the union; he became a dues-paying member in September.580</div>
      <div class="text">Undoubtedly more noteworthy to most Russians than his extra income was the attractive
         apartment which<span class="person">Oswald</span>was given in March 1959. It was a small flat with a balcony overlooking the river,581
         for which he paid only 60 rubles a month.582 (See Commission Exhibit No. 2606, p.
         271.)<span class="person">Oswald</span>describes it in his diary as "a Russian-dream." 583 Had<span class="person">Oswald</span>been a Russian worker, he would probably have had to wait for several years for a
         comparable apartment, and would have been given one even then only if he had a family.584
         The "Red Cross" subsidy and the apartment were typical of the favorable treatment
         which the Soviet Union has given defectors.585</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>'s diary records that he enjoyed his first months in Minsk. His work at the factory
         was easy and his coworkers were friendly and curious about life in the United States;
         he declined an invitation to speak at a mass meeting. He took Roza Kuznetsova, his
         interpreter and language teacher,586 to the theater, a movie, or an opera almost every
         night, until he moved into his apartment and temporarily lost contact with her. He
         wrote in his diary, "I'm living big and am very satisfied." 587 In March or April,
         he met Pavel Golovachev, a co-worker at the factory, whom<span class="person">Oswald</span>described as intelligent and friendly and an excellent radio technician. (See Commission
         Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.)<span class="person">Oswald</span>helped Golovachev with English.588 They became friends,589 and corresponded after<span class="person">Oswald</span>returned to the United States until at least as late as September 1963.590</div>
      <div class="text">The spring and summer passed easily and uneventfully. There were picnics and drives
         in the country, which<span class="person">Oswald</span>described as "green beauty." 591 On June 18, he obtained a hunting license and soon
         afterward purchased a 16-gage single-barrel shotgun. His hunting license identifies
         him as "Aleksy Harvey<span class="person">Oswald</span>." (He was called "Alec" by his Russian friends, because "Lee" sounded foreign to
         them and was difficult for them to pronounce.)592 He joined a local chapter of the
         Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, a hunting club sponsored by his factory,
         and hunted for small game in the</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 699 - Page 699</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">farm regions around Minsk about half a dozen times in the summer and fall. The hunters
         spent the night in small villages and often left their bag with the villagers;<span class="person">Oswald</span>described the peasant life which he saw as crude and poor.593 Sometime in June, he
         met. Ella German, a worker at the factory, of whom he later said he "perhaps fell
         in love with her the first minute" he saw her.594 (See Commission Exhibit No. 2609,
         p. 271.)</div>
      <div class="text">At the same time, however, the first signs of disillusionment with his Russian life
         appeared. He noted in his diary that he felt "uneasy inside" after a friend took him
         aside at a party and advised him to return to the United States.595 Another entry
         compared life in Minsk with military life:</div>
      <div class="text">I have become habituatated to a small care which is where I dine in the evening. The
         food is generaly poor and always eactly the same, menue in any care, at any point
         in the city. The food is cheap and I don't really care about quiality after three
         years in the U.S.M.C.596</div>
      <div class="text">In an entry for August-September, he wrote that he was becoming "increasingly concious
         of just what sort of a society" he lived in.597</div>
      <div class="text">He spent New Year's Day at the home of Ella German and her family. They ate and drank
         in a friendly atmosphere, and he was "drunk and happy" when he returned home. During
         the walk back to his apartment he decided to ask Ella to marry him. On the following
         night, after he had brought her home from the movies, he proposed on her doorstep.
         She rejected him, saying that she did not love him and that she was afraid to marry
         an American. She said that the Polish intervention in the 1920's had led to the arrest
         of all people in the Soviet Union of Polish origin and she feared that something similar
         might happen to Americans some day.<span class="person">Oswald</span>was "too stunned to think," and concluded that she had gone out with him only because
         she was envied by the other girls for having an American as an escort.598 But in one
         of the entries in the diary he appears to have attributed her failure to love him
         to "a state of fear which was always in the Soviet Union." 599 His affection for Ella
         German apparently continued for some time; 600 he had his last formal date with her
         in February and remained on friendly terms with her as long as he was in Russia.601</div>
      <div class="text">After he returned to the United States,<span class="person">Oswald</span>often commented on Russian life. He discussed the Soviet systems of public education
         and medical care.603 He observed to one acquaintance that everyone in Russia was trained
         to do something,604 and discussed with another the system of regular wage and salary
         increases.605 His most frequent criticisms concerned the contrast between the lives
         of ordinary workers and the lives of Communist Party members. He told an acquaintance
         in Dallas that the working class in the Soviet Union made just about enough to buy
         clothing and food and that only party members could afford luxuries.606 On another
         occasion, he remarked</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 700 - Page 700</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">that if he had as much money as some of the "managers," he could have visited the
         Black Sea resorts.607 He complained about the lack of freedom in Russia; 608 the lack
         of opportunity to travel; 609 inadequate housing; 610 and the chronic scarcity of
         food products.611 To one acquaintance, he observed that the party members were all
         "opportunists," who "shouted the loudest and made the most noise," but who were interested
         only in their own welfare.612</div>
      <div class="text">He expressed similar views in a manuscript which he worked on in Russia 613 and probably
         intended to publish; soon after he returned to the United States, he hired a stenographer
         to prepare a typed draft from his notes.614<span class="person">Oswald</span>described the manuscript, which amounted to 50 typed pages, as "a look into the lives
         of work-a-day average Russians."615</div>
      <div class="text">The manuscript describes the factory in which<span class="person">Oswald</span>worked and suggests that political considerations of which<span class="person">Oswald</span>disapproved dominated its operation. He attributed the lack of unemployment to the
         shortage of labor-saving machinery and the heavy load of bureaucracy, which kept "tons
         of paper work" flowing in and out of the factory and required a high foreman-worker
         ratio.616 In addition, he wrote, there was "a small army of examiners, committees,
         and supply checkers and the quality-control board."</div>
      <div class="text">He described life in Russia, including life at the factory, as centered around the
         "Kollective." The head of the Kollective in his shop, Comrade Lebizen, saw to it that
         everyone maintained shop discipline, attended party meetings, and received all the
         new propaganda as it came out. He hung the walls of the shop with signs and slogans
         of the Communist Party. Meetings of the Kollective were "so numerous as to be staggering."
         In a single month, there were scheduled one meeting of the professional union, four
         political information meetings, two young Communist meetings, one meeting of the production
         committee to discuss ways of improving work, two Communist Party meetings, four meetings
         of the "School of Communist Labor," and one sports meeting. All but one of them were
         compulsory for Communist Party members and all but three were compulsory for everyone.618
         (<span class="person">Marina</span><span class="person">Oswald</span>testified that her husband did not attend the courses in Marxism and Leninism given
         in the factory for party members and those who wished to become party members.)619
         They were scheduled so as not to interfere with work, and lasted anywhere from 10
         minutes to 2 hours.<span class="person">Oswald</span>said that no one liked the meetings, which were accepted "philosophically"; at the
         political meetings especially, everyone paid strict attention, and party members were
         posted in the audience to watch for the slightest sign that one's attention might
         relax, even for a moment.620</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote that the "spontaneous" demonstrations on Soviet holidays or for distinguished
         visitors were almost as well organized as the Kollectivist meetings at the factory.621
         He noted that elections were supervised to ensure that everyone voted, and that they
         voted for the candidates of the Communist Party. The manuscript touches on other aspects
         of Soviet life--as the housing shortage and the corrup-</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 701 - Page 701</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">tion which it evoked, the "rest-homes" where workers had their vacations, television
         and the omnipresent radio, and Russian reading habits.622 This writing also may include
         only what<span class="person">Oswald</span>thought might be acceptable.</div>
      <div class="text">On<span class="date">January 4, 1961</span>, I year after he had been issued his "stateless" residence permit,<span class="person">Oswald</span>was summoned to the passport office in Minsk and asked if he still wanted to become
         a Soviet citizen. He replied that he did not, but asked that his residence permit
         be extended for another year.623 The entry in his diary for January 4-31 reads: "I
         am stating to reconsider my disire about staying. The work is drab. The money I get
         has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling allys, no places of recreation acept
         the trade union dances. I have had enough." 624</div>
      <div class="text">The American Embassy in<span class="place">Moscow</span>had not heard from<span class="person">Oswald</span>after it received his letter of<span class="date">November 3, 1959</span>.625 On<span class="date">February 13, 1961</span>, it received an undated letter from him which had been mailed in Minsk about a week
         earlier. He asked for the return of his passport and stated that he wanted to return
         to the United States if he could "come to some agreement [with the American Government]
         concerning the dropping of any legal proceedings" against him. He noted that he had
         not become a Soviet citizen and was living in Russia with "nonpermanent type papers
         for a foreigner," and said that he did not appear personally because he could not
         leave Minsk without permission. The letter concluded: "I hope that in recalling the
         responsibility I have to America that you remember yours in doing everything you can
         to help me, since I am an American citizen." 626 In this letter,<span class="person">Oswald</span>referred to a previous letter which he said had gone unanswered; there is evidence
         that such a letter was never sent.627</div>
      <div class="text">The Second Secretary,<span class="person">Richard Snyder</span>, answered on February 28 that<span class="person">Oswald</span>would have to appear at the Embassy personally to discuss his return to the United
         States.628 In the meantime,<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s mother, who in January had inquired at the Department of State about his whereabouts,629
         had been notified of his letter.630 A second letter from<span class="person">Oswald</span>, posted on March 5, reached the Embassy on March 20; it reiterated that he was unable
         to leave Minsk without permission and asked that "preliminary inquiries ... be put
         in the form of questionnaire" and sent to him.631 His diary entry for this period
         records his "state of expectation about going back to the U.S.," and adds that a friend
         had approved his plans but warned him not to discuss them with others.632 (The Soviet
         authorities had undoubtedly intercepted and read the correspondence between<span class="person">Oswald</span>and the Embassy and knew of his plans.633 Soon after the correspondence began, his
         monthly payments from the "Red Cross" were cut off.)634 Having informed Washington,635
         the Embassy wrote to<span class="person">Oswald</span>on March 24, stating again that he would have to come to Moscow.636 Later, the Department
         of State decided that<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s passport should be returned to him only if he appeared at the Embassy for it and
         the Embassy was satisfied, after exploring the matter with him, that he had not renounced
         his citizenship.637</div>

      <div class="text">Sometime in the second week of March, Miss Katherine Mallory, who was on tour in Minsk
         with the University of Michigan symphonic band, found herself surrounded by curious
         Russian citizens. A young man who identified himself as a Texan and former marine
         stepped out of the crowd and asked if she needed an interpreter; he interpreted for
         her for the next 15 or 20 minutes. Later he told her that he despised the United States
         and hoped to stay in Minsk for the rest of his life. Miss Mallory is unable to swear
         that her interpreter was<span class="person">Oswald</span>, but is personally convinced that it was he.638</div>
      <div class="text">A few days later, probably on March 17,<span class="person">Oswald</span>attended a trade union dance with a friend, Erik Titovyets, at the Palace of Culture
         for Professional Workers in Minsk.639 The dance followed a lecture by a Russian woman
         who had recently returned from a trip to the United States.640<span class="person">Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova</span>arrived too late to hear the lecture 641 but was at the dance.<span class="person">Oswald</span>noticed her and asked Yuriy Merezhinskiy, the son of the lecturer and a friend of
         both<span class="person">Oswald</span>and<span class="person">Marina</span>, to introduce him to her.<span class="person">Oswald</span>asked her to dance. According to the diary, they liked each other immediately and
         he obtained her telephone number before she left.642<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that she told<span class="person">Oswald</span>that she might see him at another dance, but did not give him her telephone number.643<span class="person">Oswald</span>was smitten.644</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Marina</span>Prusakova was 19 years old when she met<span class="person">Oswald</span>. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1395, p. 270.) She was born on<span class="date">July 17, 1941</span>, at Severodvinsk (formerly Molotovsk),Arkhangel Oblast', Russia.645 A few years later,
         her mother, Klavdiya Vasilievna Prusakova, married Aleksandr Ivanovich Medvedev, who
         became the only father<span class="person">Marina</span>knew.646 While she was still a young girl,<span class="person">Marina</span>went to Arkhangel'sk, Arkhangel Oblast', to live with her maternal grandparents, Tatyana
         Yakovlevna Prusakova and Vasiliy Prusakov. Her grandfather died when<span class="person">Marina</span>was about 4 years old; she continued to live with her grandmother for some time.647
         When she was not more than 7, she moved to Zguritva, Moldavian SSR (formerly called
         Bessarabia) to live with her mother and stepfather, who was an electrical worker.648
         In 1952, the family moved to Leningrad,649 where her stepfather obtained a job in
         a power station.650<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that neither he nor her mother was a member of the Communist Party.651</div>
      <div class="text">In Leningrad,<span class="person">Marina</span>attended the Three Hundred and Seventy-Fourth Women's School. After she had completed
         the seventh grade at the school in 1955,652 she entered the Pharmacy Teknikum for
         special training, which she had requested on the ground that her mother was ill and<span class="person">Marina</span>might need to have a specialty in order to support herself. While she was st the Teknikum,
         she joined the Trade Union for Medical Workers 653 and, in her last year there, worked
         part time in the Central Pharmacy in Leningrad. She graduated from the Teknikum with
         a diploma in pharmacy in June 1959.</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Marina</span>'s mother had died in 1957, during<span class="person">Marina</span>'s second year at the Teknikum; she continued to live with her stepfather, but had
         little contact with him. She testified that she did not get along with</div>

      </div>
      <div class="text">her stepfather, whom she displeased by her fresh conduct; she said that she was not
         easily disciplined 654 and was a source of concern to him.655 Because of the friction
         between them,<span class="person">Marina</span>regarded her childhood as an unhappy one.</div>
      <div class="text">After her graduation,<span class="person">Marina</span>was assigned to a job preparing and packing orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse in
         Leningrad; as a new employee she had the right to leave this job within 3 days after
         the assignment,656 and she did so after the first day. She took no job for the next
         2 months, at the end of which she went to live in Minsk with an aunt and uncle, the
         Prusakova, who had no children. She had known them since she was a child and there
         was a mutual affection between her and them.657 Her uncle, a member of the Communist
         Party,658 was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and headed the local bureau
         concerned with lumber. The Prusakova had one of the best apartments in a building
         reserved for MVD employees.659</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Marina</span>was 18 when she arrived in Minsk. She had boyfriends in Leningrad but was not interested
         in marriage. In October 1960 she started work in the drug section of the Third Clinical
         Hospital where she earned about 450 rubles per month;660 at about the same time she
         became a member of the local Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.661 Her friends
         were mostly students, whose social life consisted of meeting in cafes to sip coffee,
         read newspapers, gossip, and carry on discussions. The group of friends "ran together,"
         and<span class="person">Marina</span>did not attach herself to a particular boyfriend. She enjoyed this life, which she
         had been leading for about 7 months when she met<span class="person">Oswald</span>at the dance at the Palace of Culture in March 1961.662</div>
      <div class="text">When<span class="person">Marina</span>met<span class="person">Oswald</span>, she thought he was from one of the Russian-speaking Baltic countries because he
         spoke with an accent; later that same evening she learned that he was an American.663
         She met him again at another dance a week later. 664 They danced together most of
         the evening, at the end of which he walked home with her. They arranged to meet again
         the following week. 665 Before the scheduled time,<span class="person">Oswald</span>called to say that he was in the hospital and that<span class="person">Marina</span>should visit him there. 666 Medical records furnished to the Commission by the Russian
         Government show that<span class="person">Oswald</span>was admitted to the Clinical Hospital--Ear, Nose, and Throat Division, on Thursday,<span class="date">March 30, 1961</span>.667<span class="person">Marina</span>visited him often,668 taking advantage of her uniform to visit him outside regular
         visiting hours, which were only on Sunday. 669 On Easter Sunday, the first Sunday
         after his admission to the hospital, she brought him an Easter egg.670 On a subsequent
         visit, he asked her to be his fiancee, and she agreed to consider it.671 He left the
         hospital on April 11.672</div>
      <div class="text">During these visits,<span class="person">Marina</span>apparently discussed with<span class="person">Oswald</span>his reasons for coming to Russia and his current status. According to her later account,
         he told her that he had surrendered his American documents to the Embassy in<span class="place">Moscow</span>and had told American officials that he did not intend to return to the United States.
         He did not say definitely that he was no longer an American citizen, but said in answer</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 704 - Page 704</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">to a question about his citizenship that he could not return to the United States.673</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>visited<span class="person">Marina</span>regularly at her aunt and uncle's apartment; they were apparently not disturbed by
         the fact that, he was an American and did not disapprove of her seeing him. He continued
         to ask her to marry him and, according to her recollection, she accepted his proposal
         on April 20; 674<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s diary puts the date 5 days earlier.675<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that she believed that<span class="person">Oswald</span>could not return to, the United States when she agreed to marry him, and that she
         had not married him in hope of going to the United States.676</div>
      <div class="text">After filing notice of their intent to marry at the registrar, obtaining the special
         consent necessary for an alien to marry a citizen, and waiting the usual 10 days,
         they were married on April 30.677 The diary entry for the wedding day reads:</div>
      <div class="text">two of<span class="person">Marina</span>s girl friends act as bridesmaids. We are married. At her aunts home we have a dinner
         reception for about 20 friends and neboribos who wish us happiness (in spite of my

         midnight we were home.678</div>
      <div class="text">They both took 3 days off from their jobs, which they spent in Minsk.679</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote in his diary for May 1, 1 day after the wedding: "In spite of fact I married<span class="person">Marina</span>to hurt Ella I found myself in love with<span class="person">Marina</span>." 680 The next entry, marked simply "May," reads in part:</div>
      <div class="text">The trasistion of changing full love from Ella to<span class="person">Marina</span>was very painfull esp. as I saw Ella almost every day at the factory but as the days
         and weeks went by I adjusted more and more [to] my wife mentaly ... She is maddly

      <div class="text">And in June: "A continuence of May, except that; we draw closer and closer, and I
         think very little now of Ella." 682</div>
      <div class="text">Sometime within the first month or two after they were married<span class="person">Oswald</span>told his wife that he was anxious to return to the United States. The diary says that
         he told her "in the last days" of June and that she was "slightly startled" but encouraged
         him to do as he wished.683<span class="person">Marina</span>'s recollection is that she learned of his plan between May and July. Embassy records
         show that<span class="person">Oswald</span>notified the Embassy in a letter received on May 25 that he was married and his wife
         would</div>
      <div class="text">

      </div>
      <div class="text">seek to accompany him to the United States.684 At about this time, the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s began to make inquiries in Soviet offices about exit visas. 685</div>
      <div class="text">While these preparations were being made, the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s apparently enjoyed their new life.686 They ate most of their meals in cares or at
         restaurants where they worked.687 For amusement, they went boating, attended the opera,
         concerts, the circus, and films; occasionally, they gathered with a group of friends
         for a cooperative meal at someone's apartment.688 His Russian improved, but he retained
         an accent and never learned to speak grammatically or to write well.689 He read the
         English language edition of the Daily Worker and books, also in English, on Marxism
         and Leninism; he also read some Russian newspapers.690</div>
      <div class="text">Before he married<span class="person">Marina</span>(and presumably before February, when he had begun his efforts to return to the United
         States)<span class="person">Oswald</span>had applied for admission to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University in Moscow.
         He received a letter dated May 3 apologizing for the delay in responding to his application
         and turning it down on the ground that the university had been established exclusively
         for students from the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
         691<span class="person">Oswald</span>expressed his disappointment at having been turned down to<span class="person">Marina</span>.692</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>reopened his correspondence with his family on May 5, with a friendly letter to his
         brother<span class="person">Robert</span>. He said nothing about, his contacts with the American Embassy, but mentioned that
         he had married, and that he had a job as a "metal-smith" and was living well. He asked
         his brother for their mother's address, and encouraged him to come to Minsk for a
         visit.693<span class="person">Robert</span>answered the letter quickly. On May 31,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote again and expressed his pleasure at having heard from<span class="person">Robert</span>after so long. Apparently in response to an offer to send him whatever he needed,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote that he needed nothing and thanked<span class="person">Robert</span>for the thought; he suggested, however, that<span class="person">Marina</span>might like a small wedding present. At the end of the letter he said that he did not
         know whether he would ever return to the United States; he said that before he could
         return he would have to obtain the permission of the Soviet Union for him and<span class="person">Marina</span>to leave and insure that no charges would be lodged against him in the United States.
         In this letter, he mentioned that he was in touch with the Embassy in Moscow.694 At
         about this time,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote also to his mother. 695</div>
      <div class="text">On May 25, the Embassy received a letter mailed in Minsk about 10 days before, in
         which<span class="person">Oswald</span>asked for assurances that he would not be prosecuted if he returned to the United
         States, and informed the Embassy that he had married a Russian woman who would want
         to accompany him.696 The Embassy communicated this development to Washington 697 and
         did not answer<span class="person">Oswald</span>immediately. In addition, he had no word since March concerning the return of his
         passport. Impatient for action,698 he appeared without warning at the Embassy on July
         8; it was a Saturday and the offices were closed.699 He used the house telephone to
         reach<span class="person">Snyder</span>, who came</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 706 - Page 706</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">to the office, talked with him briefly, and suggested that he return on the following
         Monday.700<span class="person">Oswald</span>called<span class="person">Marina</span>and asked her join him in Moscow. She arrived on Sunday, July 9, 701 a room at the
         Hotel Berlin,702 where he had stayed when he first arrived in Russia.</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>returned to the Embassy on Monday.<span class="person">Marina</span>waited outside during his interview with<span class="person">Snyder</span>,703 who asked to see<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s Soviet papers and questioned him closely about his life in Russia and possible
         expatriating acts.<span class="person">Oswald</span>stated that he was not a citizen of the Soviet Union and had never formally applied
         for citizenship, that he had never taken an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union,
         and that he was not a member of the factory trade union organization. He said that
         he had never given Soviet officials any confidential information that he had learned
         in the Marines, had never been asked to give such information, and "doubted" that
         he would have done so had he been asked.704 Some of<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s statements during this interview were undoubtedly false. He had almost certainly
         applied for citizenship in the Soviet Union 705 and, at least for a time, been disappointed
         when it was denied.706 He possessed a membership card in the union organization.707
         In addition, his assertion to<span class="person">Snyder</span>that he had never been questioned by Soviet authorities concerning his life in the
         United States is simply unbelievable.</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>showed anxiety, already displayed in his letters, that he might be prosecuted and
         imprisoned if he returned to the United States.<span class="person">Snyder</span>told him informally that he did not know any grounds on which he would be prosecuted
         but that he could give no assurances in this regard.708<span class="person">Snyder</span>testified that<span class="person">Oswald</span>seemed to have matured while he was in Russia and did not show the bravado and arrogance
         which characterized his first contacts with the Embassy.<span class="person">Oswald</span>told him that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard way" and had acquired a new appreciation
         of the United States and the meaning of freedom.709</div>
      <div class="text">Since<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s passport would expire on<span class="date">September 10, 1961</span>,710 before which date he probably would not be able to obtain Russian exit papers,
         he filled out an application for its renewal.711 On a questionnaire attached to the
         application,712 he reiterated his oral statements that he had obtained only a residence
         permit in the Soviet Union and was still an American national. On the basis of<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s written and oral statements,<span class="person">Snyder</span>concluded that he had not expatriated himself and returned his passport, stamped valid
         only for direct travel to the United States,713 to him. Accompanied by his wife,714<span class="person">Oswald</span>came to the Embassy again on the following day,715 to initiate procedures for her
         admission to the United States as an immigrant; they had a routine interview with
         McVickar,<span class="person">Snyder</span>'s assistant.716 Three days later, they returned to Minsk.717</div>
      <div class="text">On the same day,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to his brother. He told<span class="person">Robert</span>that he had his passport again and that he and<span class="person">Marina</span>were doing everything possible to leave the Soviet Union. Apparently referring to
         his initial reappearance at the Embassy in quest of his passport, he</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 707 - Page 707</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">wrote: "I could write a book about how many feeling have come and gone since that
         day." The letter closed with an affectionate greeting to his brother and his family.718
         The letter's tone of firm purpose to return to the United States in the face of heavy
         odds reflected<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s attitude thereafter.</div>
      <div class="text">As soon as they returned to Minsk, the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s began to work with local authorities for permission to leave the country.719 His
         diary entry for July 16 through August 20 reads,</div>
      <div class="text">We have found out which blanks and certificates are nessceary to apply for a exit
         visa. They number about 20 papers; birth certificates, affidavit, photos, ect. On
         Aug 20th we give the papers out they say it will be 3.5 months before we know wheather
         they let us go or not. In the meantime<span class="person">Marina</span>has had to stade 4 differant meeting at the place of work held by her boss's at the
         direction of "someone" by phone. The Young Comm. leauge headquttes also called about
         her and she had to go see them for 1-1/2 hours. The purpose (expressed) is to disuade
         her from going to the U.S.A. Net effect: Make her more stubborn about wanting to go.<span class="person">Marina</span>is pregnet. We only hope that the visas come through soon.720</div>
      <div class="text">In a letter dated July 15, he reported their efforts to the Embassy, and said that
         he would keep it informed "as to the overall picture." The letter mentioned that<span class="person">Marina</span>was having difficulties at work because of her decision to leave but added that such
         "tactics" were "quite useless" and that<span class="person">Marina</span>had "stood up well, without getting into trouble." 721 For August 21 through September
         1, the diary reads:</div>
      <div class="text">I make repeated trips to the passport and visa office, also to Ministry of For. Affairs
         in Minsk, also Min. of Internal Affairs, all of which have a say in the granting of
         a visa. I extrackted promises of quick attention to us.722</div>
      <div class="text">For September through October 18, "No word from Min. ('They'11 call us.')." 723</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Marina</span>testified that when the news of her visit to the American Embassy in July reached
         Minsk, she was dropped from membership in "Komsomol," the Communist Youth Organization,
         724 and that "meetings were arranged" at which "members of the various organizations"
         attempted to dissuade her from leaving the Soviet Union.725 Her aunt and uncle did
         not speak to her for "a long time." 726 Paul Gregory, to whom<span class="person">Marina</span>taught Russian in the United States, testified that she once referred to this period
         of her life in Minsk as "a very horrible time." 727</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to the Embassy again on October 4, to request that the U.S. Government officially
         intervene to facilitate his and his wife's applications for exit visas.728 He stated
         that there had been "systematic and concerted attempts to intimidate [<span class="person">Marina</span>] ... into with-</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 708 - Page 708</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">drawing her application for a visa" which had resulted in her being hospitalized for
         a 5-day period on September 22 for "nervous exhaustion." 729<span class="person">Marina</span>has denied that she was hospitalized for a nervous disorder 730 and he made no mention
         of it in his diary or letters to his family; he probably lied to the Embassy. The
         Embassy replied to his letter on October 12, saying that it had no way of influencing
         Soviet conduct on such matters and that its experience had been that action on applications
         for exit visas was "seldom taken rapidly." 731</div>
      <div class="text">In October 1961<span class="person">Marina</span>took her annual vacation. 732 She and<span class="person">Oswald</span>agreed that she should get a "change of scenery," 733 and she spent about 3 weeks
         with an aunt in Khar'kov. It is possible that they were not getting along well together
         during this period. 734 A dairy entry after her return indicates that they were having
         some quarrels and that she was wavering in her decision to go to the United States,
         which<span class="person">Oswald</span>attributed to anxiety about their applications for visas and the fact that she was
         pregnant; he in turn dreaded the approach of the "hard Russian winter." 735 He noted
         in his dairy that he was lonely while she was gone, but that he and his friend "Erich,"
         presumably Erik Titovyets, went to some dances and other public amusements.736 On
         his 22nd birthday he went alone to see his favorite opera, "The Queen of Spades."
         737<span class="person">Marina</span>sent him a gold and silver cup, inscribed "To my dear husband on his birthday, 18/x/61"
         and other gifts, for which he wrote to thank her.738 She returned on November 12,
         in<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s words, "radient, with several jars of preserses for me from her aunt." 739</div>
      <div class="text">Sometime after<span class="person">Marina</span>'s return<span class="person">Oswald</span>applied for an interview with Col. Nicolay Aksenov, an official in the local MVD,
         in an effort to expedite their application for exit visas; he was told by the colonel's
         subordinates that they were competent to handle the matter.<span class="person">Oswald</span>then insisted that<span class="person">Marina</span>seek an interview; she agreed reluctantly. The interview was granted; 740<span class="person">Marina</span>thought that this might have been due to the fact that her uncle was also a high-ranking
         official in the Minsk MVD, but she did not believe that he would personally have presumed
         on his official position to obtain special treatment.741 Colonel Aksenov questioned
         her about her reasons for wanting to go to the United States and, noticing that she
         was pregnant, suggested that she at least delay her departure so that her child could
         be born in Russia, but did not otherwise try to discourage her. He finally told her
         that there were many others seeking visas and that she and her husband would have
         to wait their turn.742</div>
      <div class="text">Throughout this period,<span class="person">Oswald</span>continued to correspond with his mother and brother. His letters contained the usual
         chatter among members of a family and occasional references to the progress of the
         visa applications.743 He wrote to the Embassy on November 1, saying that if, as he
         anticipated, his residence permit were renewed in January for another year, it would
         be over his protest. 744 On November 13 the Embassy replied, telling<span class="person">Oswald</span>that retention of his Soviet passport, which was of the kind issued to persons considered
         to be stateless, or an extension of it, would not prejudice his claim to Ameri-</div>

      </div>
      <div class="text">can citizenship. The letter added that he could discuss the renewal of his American
         passport whenever he appeared in person at the Embassy to do so.745</div>
      <div class="text">Late in December,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote a letter to Senator John G. Tower of Texas, which was received in Washington
         near the end of January. He stated that he was an American citizen and that the Soviet
         Government refused to permit him and his wife to leave the Soviet Union. He asked
         Senator Tower to raise "the question of holding by the Soviet Union of a citizen of
         the U.S., against his will and expressed desires." The letter was referred to the
         State Department and no further action concerning it was taken.746 On December 25,<span class="person">Marina</span>was called to the Soviet Passport Office and told that exit visas would be granted
         to her and her husband; she was surprised, having doubted that she would ever be permitted
         to leave.<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to the Embassy on December 27 that they would be given visas and asked that
         his passport be extended without another trip to Moscow; he added, however, that he
         would come to<span class="place">Moscow</span>if this would expedite the processing of his application. In his diary, he wrote,
         "It's great (I think?)." 747 Before the year ended,<span class="person">Marina</span>went on maternity leave from her job.748 They spent New Year's Eve at a dinner party
         given by the Zigers.749</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to his mother on<span class="date">January 2, 1962</span>, and told her that he and his wife expected to arrive in the United States sometime
         around March. He asked her to contact the local Red Cross and request that it put
         his case before the International Rescue Committee or some other group which aids
         immigrants to the United States. He told her that he would need about $800 and that
         she should insist on a gift rather than a loan; he told her not to send any of her
         own money.750 Despite his instructions, she requested a loan from the Red Cross.751
         On January 13,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to the International Rescue Committee himself; he asked for $800 with which
         to purchase two tickets from<span class="place">Moscow</span>to Texas.752 He wrote to the Committee again on January 26, this time asking for $1,000.753</div>
      <div class="text">In the meantime, letters of<span class="person">Oswald</span>754 and the American Embassy,755 both dated January 5, crossed in the mail. The Embassy's
         letter suggested that since there might be difficulties in obtaining an American visa
         for<span class="person">Marina</span>, he consider returning alone and bringing her over later. He replied on the 16th
         that he would not leave Russia without her.756 In his letter,<span class="person">Oswald</span>requested that the U.S. Government loan him the money for his and<span class="person">Marina</span>'s airplane tickets or arrange a loan from another source. The Embassy replied on
         January 15 that<span class="person">Marina</span>had not yet obtained an American visa and that no evidence had yet been submitted
         that she would not become a public charge in the United States.757 It suggested that<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s mother or some other close relative file an affidavit of support in<span class="person">Marina</span>'s behalf. Before receiving this letter,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote out such a document himself 758 and mailed it to the Embassy.759</div>
      <div class="text">On January 28, after receiving the Embassy's letter, he wrote that his own affidavit
         should be sufficient, since he had been away from</div>

      </div>
      <div class="text">the United States for more than 2 years and could not be expected to obtain an affidavit
         from someone else.760 But on the same day, he wrote to his mother asking that she
         file an affidavit of support with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.761 On
         January 24, the Embassy acknowledged receipt of his affidavit, but again suggested
         that he obtain one from someone else.762</div>
      <div class="text">Late in January,<span class="person">Oswald</span>received a letter from his mother telling him that he had been given a dishonorable
         discharge from the Marines.763 (The discharge had actually been "undesirable," a less
         derogatory characterization.) 764 This apparently revived his fear of prosecution,
         and on January 30, he wrote to his brother for more information.765 On the same day
         he wrote also to John B. Connally, Jr., then Governor of Texas, who<span class="person">Oswald</span>believed was still Secretary of Navy. The letter read:</div>
      <div class="text">I wish to call your attention to a case about which you may have personal knowlege
         since you are a resident of Ft. Worth as I am.</div>
      <div class="text">In November 1959 an event was well publicated in the Ft. Worth newspapers concerning
         a person who had gone to the Soviet Union to reside for a short time, (much in the
         same way E. Hemingway resided in Paris.)</div>
      <div class="text">This person in answers to questions put to him by reporteds in<span class="place">Moscow</span>criticized certain facets of american life. The story was blown up into another "turncoat"
         sensation, with the result that the Navy department gave this person a belated dishonourable
         discharge, although he had received an honourable discharge after three years service
         on Sept. 11, 1959 at El Toro, Marine corps base in California.</div>
      <div class="text">These are the basic facts of my case.</div>
      <div class="text">I have and allways had the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy,<span class="place">Moscow</span>USSR. and hence the U.S. government. In as much as I am returning to the U.S.A. in
         this year with the aid of the U.S. Embassy, bring with me my family (since I married
         in the USSR) I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to
         a boni-fied U.S. citizen and ex--service man. The U.S. government has no charges or
         complaints against me. I ask you to look into this case. and take the neccessary steps
         to repair the damage done to me. and my family. For information I would direct you
         to consult the American Embassy, Chikovski St. 19/21, Moscow, USSR.766</div>
      <div class="text">Connally referred the letter to the Department of the Navy,767 which sent<span class="person">Oswald</span>a letter stating that the Department contemplated no change in the undesirable discharge.
         768 On March 22,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to the Department insisting that his discharge be given a further, full review.769
         The Department promptly replied that it had no authority to hear and review petitions
         of this sort and referred<span class="person">Oswald</span>to the Navy Discharge Review Board.770<span class="person">Oswald</span>filled out</div>

      <div class="text">the enclosed application for review in Minsk but did not mail it until he returned
         to the United States.771</div>
      <div class="text">The Department of State had notified<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s mother that it would need $900 to make the travel arrangements for her son and
         daughter-in-law.772 On February 1,<span class="person">Oswald</span>sent his mother a brief letter rejecting her suggestion that she try to raise money
         by telling the newspapers about his financial plight.773 Five days later, the Embassy<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to his mother again on February 9, reminding her to file an affidavit of support
         and asking that she send him clippings from the<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>newspapers about his defection to Russia, a request which he later repeated to his
         brother. He told her that he wanted to know what had been written about him, so that
         he could be "forewarned."</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>took<span class="person">Marina</span>to the hospital on the morning of February 15. A baby girl was born at about 10 a.m.776
         He had gone on to the factory where news of the birth awaited him on his arrival.777
         In accordance with regular hospital practice,778 he did not see the baby until<span class="person">Marina</span>left the hospital.779 He was excited by the child,780 who was named "<span class="person">June Lee</span>" in accordance with the Russian custom and law that a child's second name must be
         the father's first name or a variation of it. He had wanted to name his child "June<span class="person">Marina</span>," and protested the application of the law to her, since he had a United States passport.
         His diary contains the wry comment, "Po-Russki." 781 His coworkers at the factory
         gave the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s "one summer blanket, 6 light diapers, 4 warm diapers, 2 chemises, 3 very good warm
         chemises, 4 very nice suits and two toys" for the baby.782<span class="person">Marina</span>came home on February 23.783</div>
      <div class="text">There was less urgency about the departure for the United States after<span class="person">June Lee</span>was born.784<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote to his mother,785 and brother,786 that he would probably not arrive for several
         months. The Embassy received a letter on March 3, in which<span class="person">Oswald</span>applied for a loan of $800; 787 the Embassy replied that it was authorized to loan
         him only $500.788 It had in the meantime decided that his own affidavit of support
         for<span class="person">Marina</span>would be sufficient under the circumstances.789 On March 15, he received notification
         from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that<span class="person">Marina</span>'s application for a visa had been approved.790 By March 28, he had received an affidavit
         of support in<span class="person">Marina</span>'s behalf from his mother's employer, Byron K. Phillips, 791 which he filed although
         it was no longer necessary to do so.792 A few days before,<span class="person">Marina</span>, still on maternity leave, had quit her job. 793 Discussions with the Embassy to
         complete financial and travel arrangements continued in April and May.794 In a letter
         to<span class="person">Robert</span>on April 12,<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote that only "the American side" was holding up their departure, but added that
         the winter being over, he didn't "really ... want to leave until the beginning of
         fall, since the spring and summer ... [in Russia] are so nice." 795</div>

         <div class="page">Page 712 - Page 712</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">On May 10, the Embassy wrote that everything was in order and suggested that<span class="person">Oswald</span>come to the Embassy with his family to sign the final papers.796 At his request,797
         he was discharged from the factory on about May 18.798 His work had apparently never
         been very good.<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that he was rather lazy and resented having to take orders.799 This estimate
         is confirmed by a report of the plant director and personnel department chief, filed
         on<span class="date">December 11, 1961</span>, which was apparently a routine assessment of his work. The report noted that he
         did not, "display the initiative for increasing his skill" in his job, that he was
         "over-sensitive ... to remarks from the foremen, and ... careless in his work";<span class="person">Oswald</span>took "no part in the social life of the shop" and kept "very much to himself." 800</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>picked up his Soviet, exit visa on May 22; 801 at about this time, he also had an
         interview with an official of the MVD to obtain final clearance for his departure.
         802 He wrote to<span class="person">Robert</span>that he and his family would leave for<span class="place">Moscow</span>on the following day and depart for England 10 to 14 days later. He expected to cross
         the Atlantic by ship, probably docking in New Orleans. Returning to a point which
         he had made in an earlier letter to his mother, he commented that he knew from the
         newspaper clippings what<span class="person">Robert</span>had said about him when he left for Russia; he thought that<span class="person">Robert</span>had talked too much at that time, and asked that<span class="person">Robert</span>say nothing to the newspapers now. 803</div>
      <div class="text">The<span class="person">Oswald</span>s arrived in<span class="place">Moscow</span>by May 24 804 and on that date filled out various documents at the American Embassy;
         805<span class="person">Marina</span>was given her American visa.806 Final arrangements for their emigration were made
         with Soviet officials. 807 On June 1,<span class="person">Oswald</span>signed a promissory note at the Embassy for a repatriation loan of $435.71.808 He
         and his family boarded a train for Holland,809 which passed through Minsk that night.810
         They crossed the Soviet frontier at Brest on June 2. Two days later, they departed
         from Holland on the SS Maasdam. 811 Onboard ship, the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s stayed by themselves;<span class="person">Marina</span>testified that she did not often go on deck because she was poorly dressed and<span class="person">Oswald</span>was ashamed of her.812</div>
      <div class="text">Probably while he was on board the Maasdam<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote some notes on ship stationery, which appear to be a summary of what he thought
         he had learned by living under both the capitalist and Communist systems. The notes
         reflect his unhappy and deepening feeling of disillusionment with both the Soviet
         Union and the United States.<span class="person">Oswald</span>observed that although reform groups may oppose the government in power, they always
         declare that they are for their people and their country, and he asked what "would
         happen if somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly opposed not, only to the
         governments, but to the people, too the entire land and complete foundations" of his
         society. He condemned existing political groups and proposed the formation of a third
         choice between communism and capitalism. neither of which was acceptable to him. "I
         have lived," he said, under both systems I have sought the answers and although it
         would</div>
      <div class="text">
         <div class="page">Page 713 - Page 713</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text">be very easy to dupe myself into believing one system is better than the other, I
         know they are not." In these notes, he acknowledged that his "Red Cross" subsidy had
         been paid by the Soviet Government rather than the international organization, and
         said, "I shall never sell myself intentionlly, or unintentionlly to anyone again."
         (Commission Exhibit No. 25, p. 273.) It was probably also onboard ship that<span class="person">Oswald</span>wrote two sets of answers to questions which he anticipated about his decision to
         go to Russia. and later to return to the United States. Although the sets of answers
         are somewhat similar, but the tone of one is apologetic, while the other suggests
         that<span class="person">Oswald</span>went to Russia to study the Soviet system, but remained a loyal American and owed
         no apologies.814</div>
      <div class="text">The Maasdam landed at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13.815 The<span class="person">Oswald</span>s were met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler's Aid Society, which
         had been contacted by the Department of State; Raikin had the impression that<span class="person">Oswald</span>was trying to avoid meeting anyone. He told Raikin that he had only $63 and had no
         plans either for that night or for travel to Fort Worth, and accepted the society's
         help, according to Raikin, "with confidence and appreciation."816 They passed through
         the immigration office without incident,817 and Raikin helped them through customs.818</div>
      <div class="text">The society referred the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s to the New York City Department of Welfare, which helped them find a room at the
         Times Square Hotel.819<span class="person">Oswald</span>told both Raikin and representatives of the welfare department that he had been a
         marine stationed at the American Embassy in Moscow, had married a Russian girl, renounced
         his citizenship, and worked in Minsk; he soon found out, he said, that the Russian
         propaganda was inaccurate but had not been able to obtain an exit visa for his wife
         and child for more than 2 years. He said also that he had paid the travel expenses
         himself.820</div>
      <div class="text">The welfare department called<span class="person">Robert Oswald</span>'s home in Fort Worth. His wife answered and said that they would help. She contacted
         her husband who sent $200 immediately.821<span class="person">Oswald</span>refused to accept the money and insisted that the department itself should pay the
         fare to Texas; he threatened that they would go as far as they could on $63 and rely
         on local authorities to get them the rest of the way. In the end he accepted the money.822
         On the afternoon of June 14, the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s left New York by plane for Fort Worth.823</div>

      <div class="text">FORT WORTH, DALLAS, NEW ORLEANS</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>had originally indicated that he and his family would stay with his mother in Vernon,
         Tex.824 His decision to stay with<span class="person">Robert Oswald</span>in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>apparently had been prompted by his brother's invitation in a letter to him in Russia.825<span class="person">Oswald</span>listed only his brother as a relative on an "Intake Interview" form which he prepared
         for the New York Department of Welfare.826</div>

      <div class="text"><span class="person">Robert</span>took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas airport, to meet Lee and<span class="person">Marina</span>and their baby,<span class="person">June Lee</span>.827 He testified that the most noticeable change in his brother's appearance was
         that he had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat thinner than he had
         been in 1959.<span class="person">Robert</span>thought that his brother had picked up "something of an accent" but, except for these
         changes was "the same boy" whom he had known before.828 Lee commented on the absence
         of newspaper reporters and seemed to<span class="person">Robert</span>to be disappointed that none had appeared.829 Later on, Lee was anxious to avoid publicity.830</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Robert</span>drove the<span class="person">Oswald</span>s to his home at 7313 Davenport Street.831 For a few days, Lee seemed tense,832 but
         the brothers got along well,833 and to<span class="person">Robert</span>it was "more or less ... [as if Lee] had not been to Russia"; they were "just together
         again." 834 They did not discuss politics, according to<span class="person">Robert</span>because of a "tacit agreement" between them.835 Lee indicated to his brother that
         he hoped to have his undesirable discharge from the Marines corrected.836<span class="person">Robert</span>and his wife "took to<span class="person">Marina</span>and June," and enjoyed showing<span class="person">Marina</span>"things that she had never seen before." 837<span class="person">Marina</span>rested and took care of her baby, and when she could, helped in the household.838
         She testified that, apart from a trip to the library, Lee spent about a week "merely
         talking." 839</div>
      <div class="text">On June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth,<span class="person">Oswald</span>went to the office of Mrs. Pauline Virginia Bates, a public stenographer whose name
         he had found in the telephone directory,840 and asked her to type a manuscript from
         the "scraps of paper," on which he had recorded his impressions of the Soviet Union.841
         Intrigued by his tale that he had just returned from the Soviet Union and had smuggled
         his notes out of that country, she agreed to type the notes for $1 per page or $2
         an hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate.842 On that day and the succeeding
         2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing for<span class="person">Oswald</span>while he remained in her office helping her with the notes and translating portions
         of them which were in Russian.843 At the end of each session he collected his notes
         and as much of the manuscript as she had done and took them away with him.844 On June
         20, he gave Mrs. Bates $10 for the 10 completed pages; he told her that he had no
         more money and refused to accept her offer to postpone pay-merit or continue the work
         for nothing.845</div>
      <div class="text"><span class="person">Oswald</span>told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>who wanted to help him publish his notes.846 On June 19,847 he had called Peter Gregory,
         a petroleum engineer who was born in Siberia and taught Russian at the<span class="place">Fort Worth</span>Public Library as a "civic enterprise." 848 He asked if Gregory could give him a letter
         testifying to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could obtain work
         as an interpreter or translator. Gregory suggested that<span class="person">Oswald</span>come to his office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at random and asked<span class="person">Oswald</span>to read from it.<span class="person">Oswald</span>read well, and Gregory gave him the letter he wanted.849 Gregory and<span class="person">Oswald</span>had lunch together and discussed<span class="person">Oswald</span>'s life in the Soviet Union,850 but, according to Gregory's testimony, nothing was

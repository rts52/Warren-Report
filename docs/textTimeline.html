            			LEE HARVEY OSWALD spent almost all of the last 48 hours of his life in the Police and Courts Building,
            a gray stone structure in downtown Dallas that housed the headquarters of the Dallas
            Police Department and the city jail. Following his arrest early Friday afternoon,
            Oswald was brought immediately to this building and remained there until Sunday morning,
            November 24, when he was scheduled to be transferred to the county jail. At 11:21 that morning, in full view of millions of people watching on television, Oswald was fatally wounded by Jack Ruby, who emerged suddenly from the crowd of newsmen
            and policemen witnessing the transfer and fired a single shot at Oswald.
            		
            		
            			Whether the killing of Oswald was part of a conspiracy involving the assassination of President Kennedy is considered in chapter VI. Aside from that question, the occurrences within the
            Police and Courts Building between November 22 and 24 raise other important issues concerning the conduct of law enforcement officials,
            the responsibilities of the press, the rights of accused persons, and the administration
            of criminal justice in the United States. The Commission has therefore deemed it necessary
            to determine the facts concerning Oswald's detention and death and to evaluate the actions and responsibilities of the police
            and press involved in these events.
            		
            		
            		TREATMENT OF OSWALD IN CUSTODY
            		
            		The focal center of the Police and Courts Building during Oswald's detention was the third floor, which housed the main offices of the Dallas Police
            Department. The public elevators on this floor opened into a lobby midpoint of a corridor
            that extended along the length of the floor for about 140 feet. At one end of this
            7-foot-wide corridor were the offices occupied by Chief of Police Jesse E. Curry and
            his immediate subordinates; at the other end was a small pressroom that could accommodate
            only a handful of reporters. Along this corridor were other police offices, including
            those of the major detective bureaus. Between the pressroom and the lobby was the
            complex of offices

            		belonging to the homicide and robbery bureau, headed by Capt. J. Will Fritz. (See
            Commission Exhibit No. 2175, p. 197.) Chronology
            		
            		
            		The policemen who seized Oswald at the Texas Theatre arrived with him at the police department building at about2 p.m. and brought him immediately to the third floor offices of the homicide and robbery
            bureau to await the arrival of Captain Fritz from the Texas School Book Depository.
            After about 15 or 20 minutes Oswald was ushered into the office of Captain Fritz for the first of several interrogation
            sessions. At 4:05 p.m. he was taken to the basement assembly room for his first lineup. While waiting outside
            the lineup room, Oswald was searched, and five cartridges and other items were removed from his pockets.
            After the lineup, at about 4 :20, Oswald was returned to Captain Fritz' office for further questioning. Two hours later, at
            6:20 p.m., Oswald was taken downstairs for a second lineup and returned to Captain Fritz' office within
            15 minutes for additional interrogation. Shortly after 7 p.m., Captain Fritz signed a complaint charging Oswald with the murder of Patrolman Tippit. Oswald was formally arraigned, i.e., advised of the charges, at 7:10 p.m., before Justice of the Peace David L. Johnston, who came to Captain Fritz' office
            for the occasion.
            		
            		
            			After a third lineup at about 7:40 p.m., Oswald was returned to Fritz' office. About an hour later, after further questioning, Oswald's fingerprints and palmprints were taken and a paraffin test (see app. XI) administered
            in Fritz' office, after which the questioning resumed. At 11:26 p.m. Fritz signed the complaint charging Oswald with the murder of President Kennedy. 10 Shortly after midnight, detectives took Oswald to the basement assembly room for an appearance of several minutes before members
            of the press. At about 12 :20 a.m. Oswald was delivered to the jailer who placed him in a maximum security cell on the fifth
            floor. 12 His cell was the center one in a block of three cells that were separated
            from the remainder of the jail area. The cells on either side of Oswald were empty and a guard was nearby whenever Oswald was present. Shortly after 1:30 a.m. Oswald was brought to the identification bureau on the fourth floor and arraigned before
            Justice of the Peace Johnston, this time for the murder President Kennedy.
            		
            		
            			Questioning resumed in Fritz' office on Saturday morning at about 10:25 a.m., and the session lasted nearly an hour and 10 minutes. Oswald was then returned to his cell for an hour, and at 12:35 p.m. he was brought back to Fritz' office for an additional half-hour of questioning.
            From 1:10 to 1:30 p.m., Oswald's wife and mother visited him in the fourth floor visiting area;17 at 1:40 p.m. he attempted to call an attorney in New York. 18 He appeared in another lineup at,
            2:15 p.m.19 At 2:45 p.m., with Oswald's consent, a member of the identification bureau obtained fingernail scrapings and
            specimens of hair from him. He returned to the fourth floor at 3:30
            
            		Page 199
            		
            		
            		p.m. for a 10-minute visit with his brother, Robert. 21 Between 4 and 4:30 p.m.,Oswald made two telephone calls to Mrs. Ruth Paine 22 at her home in Irving; at about 5:30 p.m. he was visited by the president of the Dallas Bar Association 23 with whom he spoke
            for about 5 minutes. From 6 to 7:15 p.m. Oswald was interrogated once again in Captain Fritz' office and then returned to his cell.
            24 At 8 p.m. he called the Paine residence again and asked to speak to his wife, but Mrs. Paine
            told him that his wife was no longer there.
            
            			Oswald was signed out of jail at 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, November 24, and taken to Captain Fritz' office for a final round of questioning. The transfer
            party left Fritz' office at about 11:15 a.m.;27 at 11:21 a.m. Oswald was shot. He was declared dead at Parkland Hospital at 1:07 p.m.29
            		
            		
            		Interrogation Sessions
            		
            		
            		During the period between 2:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon and 11:15 a.m. Sunday morning, Oswald was interrogated for a total of approximately 12 hours. Though subject to intermittent
            questioning for more than 7 hours on Friday, Oswald was given 8 to 9 hours to rest that night. On Saturday he was questioned for a total
            of only 3 hours during three interrogation sessions, and on Sunday he was questioned
            for less than 2 hours. 31 (These interrogations are discussed in ch. IV.)
            		
            		
            		Captain Fritz' office, within which the interrogations took place, was a small room,
            14 feet by 9 and a half feet in size. 32 In addition to the policemen guarding the
            prisoner, those present usually included Dallas detectives, investigators from the
            FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally other officials, particularly a post
            office inspector and the U.S. marshal. (See statements in app. XI.) As many as seven
            or eight people crowded into the small office. In all, more than 25 different persons
            participated in or were present at some time during interrogations. Captain Fritz,
            who conducted most of the interrogations, was frequently called from the room. He
            said, "I don't believe there was any time when I went through a very long period without
            having to step to the door, or step outside, to get a report from some pair of officers,
            or to give them additional assignments." 34 In his absence, others present would occasionally
            question Oswald.
            		
            		
            		The interrogators differ on whether the confusion prevailing in the main third floor
            corridor penetrated Fritz' office and affected the atmosphere within. Oswald's processions through the third floor corridor, described more fully below, tended,
            in Fritz' opinion, to keep Oswald upset, and the remarks and questions of newsmen sometimes caused him to become annoyed.
            Despite the confusion that frequently prevailed, Oswald remained calm most of the time during the interrogations. According to Captain Fritz:
            		
            		You know I didn't have trouble with him. If we would just talk to him quietly like
            we are talking right now, we talked all right until I asked him a question that meant
            something, every
            		Page 200
            		
            		time I asked him a question that meant something, that would produce evidence he
            immediately told me he wouldn't tell me about it and he seemed to anticipate what
            I was going to ask. 38
            		
            		Special Agent James W. Bookhout, who represented the FBI at most of the interrogations,
            stated, "I think generally you might say anytime that you asked a question that would
            be pertinent to the investigation, that would be the type of question he would refuse
            to discuss." 39
            		
            		
            		The number of people in the interrogation room and the tumultuous atmosphere throughout
            the third floor made it difficult for the interrogators to gain Oswald's confidence and to encourage him to be truthful. As Chief Curry has recognized in
            his testimony, "we were violating every principle of interrogation ... it was just
            against all principles of good interrogation practice." 40
            
            		Oswald's Legal Rights
            		
            		
            		All available evidence indicates that Oswald was not subjected to any physical hardship during the interrogation sessions or at
            any other time while he was in custody. He was fed and allowed to rest. When he protested
            on Friday against being handcuffed from behind, the cuffs were removed and he was
            handcuffed in front. 41 Although he made remarks to newsmen about desiring a shower
            and demanding his "civil rights," Oswald did not complain about his treatment to any of the numerous police officers and other
            persons who had much to do with him during the 2 days of his detention. As described
            in chapter IV, Oswald received a slight cut over his right eye and a bruise under his left eye during the
            scuffle in the Texas Theatre with the arresting officers, three of whom were injured
            and required medical treatment. These marks were visible to all who saw him during
            the 2 days of his detention and to millions of television viewers.
            		
            		
            		Before the first questioning session on Friday afternoon, Fritz warned Oswald that he was not compelled to make any statement and that statements he did make could
            be used against him. About 5 hours later, he was arraigned for the Tippit murder and
            within an additional 6 and a half hours he was arraigned for the murder of President Kennedy. On each occasion the justice of the peace advised Oswald of his right to obtain counsel and the right to remain silent.
            		
            		
            		Throughout the period of detention, however, Oswald was not represented by counsel. At the Friday midnight press conference in the basement
            assembly room, he made the following remarks:
            		Oswald. Well, I was questioned by Judge-------[Johnston]. However, I protested at that time
            that I was not allowed legal representation during that very short and sweet hearing.
            I really don't know what the situation is about. Nobody has told me anything except
            that I am accused of, of, murdering a policeman.
            		Page 201
            		
            		I know nothing more than that and I do request someone to come forward to give me
            legal assistance.
            		
            		
            		Q. Did you kill the President?
            		
            		
            		A. No. I have not been charged with that. In fact nobody has said that to me yet.
            The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked
            me that question.
            		
            		
            		Q. Mr. Oswald, how did you hurt your eye?
            		
            		
            		A. A policeman hit me.
            		
            		At this time Oswald had been arraigned only for the murder of Patrolman Tippit, but questioning by Captain
            Fritz and others had been substantially concerned with Oswald's connection with the assassination.
            		
            		
            		On Friday evening, representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union visited
            the police department to determine whether Oswald was being deprived of counsel. They were assured by police officials and Justice
            of the Peace Johnston that Oswald had been informed of his rights and was being allowed to seek a lawyer. On Saturday
            Oswald attempted several times to reach John Abt, a New York lawyer, by telephone, but with
            no success. 49 In the afternoon, he called Ruth Paine and asked her to try to reach
            Abt for him, but she too failed. 50 Later in the afternoon, H. Louis Nichols, president
            of the Dallas Bar Association, visited Oswald in his cell and asked him whether he wanted the association to obtain a lawyer for
            him. Oswald declined the offer, stating a first preference for Abt and a second preference for
            a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union. As late as Sunday morning, according
            to Postal Inspector Harry D. Holmes, Oswald said that he preferred to get his own lawyer.
            		
            	    
            		Within an hour of Oswald's arrival at the police department on November 22, it became known to newsmen that he was a possible suspect in the slaying of President Kennedy as well as in the murder of Patrolman Tippit. At least as early as 3:26 p.m. a television report carried this information. Reporters and cameramen flooded into
            the building and congregated in the corridor of the third floor, joining those few
            who had been present when Oswald first arrived.
            		
            		
            		On the Third Floor
            		
            		
            		Felix McKnight, editor of the Dallas Times-Herald, who handled press arrangements
            for the President's visit, estimated that within 24 hours of the assassination more
            than 800 representatives of news media were in Dallas, including correspondents from
            foreign newspapers and press associations. District Attorney Henry M. Wade
            
            		Page 202
            		
            		
            			thought that the crowd in the third floor hallway itself may have numbered as many
            as 300. Most estimates, including those based on examination of video tapes, place
            upwards of 100 newsmen and cameramen in the third floor corridor of the police department
            by the evening of November 22. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2633, p. 203.)
            		
            		
            		In the words of an FBI agent who was present, the conditions at the police station
            were "not too much unlike Grand Central Station at rush hour, maybe like the Yankee
            Stadium during the World Series games...." 57 In the lobby of the third floor, television
            cameramen set up two large cameras and floodlights in strategic positions that gave
            them a sweep of the corridor in either direction. Technicians stretched their television
            cables into and out of offices, running some of them out of the windows of a deputy
            chief's office and down the side of the building. Men with newsreel cameras, still
            cameras, and microphones, more mobile than the television cameramen, moved back and
            forth seeking information and opportunities for interviews. Newsmen wandered into
            the offices of other bureaus located on the third floor, sat on desks, and used police
            telephones; indeed, one reporter admits hiding a telephone behind a desk so that he
            would have exclusive access to it if something developed.
            		
            		
            		By the time Chief Curry returned to the building in the middle of the afternoon
            from Love Field where he had escorted President Johnson from Parkland Hospital, he
            found that "there was just pandemonium on the third floor." 59 The news representatives,
            he testified:
            		... were jammed into the north hall of the third floor, which are the offices of
            the criminal investigation division. The television trucks, there were several of
            them around the city hall. I went into my administrative offices, I saw cables coming
            through the administrative assistant office and through the deputy chief of traffic
            through his office, and running through the hall they had a live TV set up on the
            third floor, and it was a bedlam of confusion.
            		
            		According to Special Agent Winston G. Lawson of the Secret Service:
            		
            		At least by 6 or 7 o'clock ... [the reporters and cameramen] were quite in evidence
            up and down the corridors, cameras on the tripods, the sound equipment, people with
            still cameras, motion picture-type hand cameras, all kinds of people with tape recorders,
            and they were trying to interview people, anybody that belonged in police headquarters
            that might know anything about Oswald ... 61
            		
            		The corridor became so jammed that policemen and newsmen had to push and shove if
            they wanted to get through, stepping over cables,

            third floor corridor.
            
            		Page 204
            		
            		
            		wires, and tripods. The crowd in the hallway was so dense that District Attorney
            Wade found it a "strain to get the door open" to get into the homicide office. According
            to Lawson, "You had to literally fight your way through the people to get up and down
            the corridor." 64 A witness who was escorted into the homicide offices on Saturday
            afternoon related that he
            		
            		tried to get by the reporters, stepping over television cables and you couldn't
            hardly get by, they would grab you and wanted to know what you were doing down here,
            even with the detectives one in front and one behind you.
            		
            		The television cameras continued to record the scene on the third floor as some
            of the newsmen kept vigil through the night.
            		
            		
            		Such police efforts as there were to control the newsmen were unavailing. Capt.
            Glen D. King, administrative assistant to Chief Curry, witnessed efforts to clear
            an aisle through the hallway, but related that "this was a constant battle because
            of the number of newsmen who were there. They would move back into the aisleway that
            had been cleared. They interfered with the movement of people who had to be there."
            67 According to one detective, "they would be asked to stand back and stay back but
            it wouldn't do much good, and they would push forward and you had to hold them off
            physically." The detective recalled that on one occasion when he was escorting a witness
            through the corridor he "stopped ... and looked down and there was a joker had a camera
            stuck between ... [his] legs taking pictures. ... "68 Forrest V. Sorrels of the Secret
            Service had the impression that the "press and the television people just ... took
            over." 69
            		
            		
            		Police control over the access of other than newsmen to the third floor was of limited
            but increasing effectiveness after Oswald's arrival at the police department. Initially no steps. were taken to exclude unauthorized
            persons from the third floor corridor, but late Friday afternoon Assistant Chief Charles
            Batchelor stationed guards at the elevators and the stairway to prevent the admission
            of such persons. He also directed the records room in the basement to issue passes,
            after verification by the bureaus involved, to people who had legitimate business
            on the third floor. Throughout the 3 days of Oswald's detention, the police were obliged to continue normal business in all five bureaus
            located along the third floor hallway. Thus many persons--relatives of prisoners,
            complainants, witnesses 71 --had occasion to visit police offices on the third floor
            on business unrelated to the investigation of the assassination.
            		
            		
            		Newsmen seeking admission to the third floor were required to identify themselves
            by their personal press cards; however, the department did not follow its usual procedure
            of checking the authenticity of press credentials. Captain King felt that this would
            have been impossible in light of "the atmosphere that existed over there, the tremendous
            pressures that existed, the fact that telephones were ringing constantly,
            
            		Page 205

            		Page 206
            		
            		
            		that there were droves of people in there ... the fact that the method by which
            you positively identify someone ... it's not easy." 73
            		
            		
            		Police officers on the third floor testified that they carefully checked all persons
            for credentials, and most newsmen indicated that after Batchelor imposed security
            they were required to identify themselves by their press cards. Special Agent Sorrels
            of the Secret Service stated that he was requested to present credentials on some
            of his visits to the third floor. However, other newsmen apparently went unchallenged
            during the entire period before Oswald was killed, although some of them were wearing press badges on their lapels and some
            may have been known to the police officers. 76
            		
            		
            		According to some reporters and policemen, people who appeared to be unauthorized
            were present on the third floor after security procedures were instituted, and video
            tapes seem to confirm their observations. Jack Ruby was present on the third floor
            on Friday night. Assistant Chief of Police N. T. Fisher testified that even on Saturday
            "anybody could come up with a plausible reason for going to one of the third floor
            bureaus and was able to get in." 79
            
            		Oswald and the Press
            		
            		
            		When the police car bringing Oswald from the Texas Theatre drove into the basement of police headquarters at about 2 p.m. on Friday, some reporters and cameramen, principally from local papers and stations,
            were already on hand. The policemen formed a wedge around Oswald and conducted him to the elevator, but several newsmen crowded into the elevator
            with Oswald and the police. When the elevator stopped at the third floor, the cameramen ran ahead
            down the corridor, and then turned around and backed up, taking pictures of Oswald as he was escorted toward the homicide and robbery bureau office. According to one
            escorting officer, some six or seven reporters followed the police into the bureau
            office.
            		
            		
            		From Friday afternoon, when Oswald arrived in the building, until Sunday, newspaper reporters and television cameras
            focused their attention on the homicide office. In full view and within arm's length
            of the assembled newsmen, Oswald traversed the 20 feet of corridor between the homicide office and the locked door
            leading to the jail elevator at least 15 times after his initial arrival. The jail
            elevator, sealed off from public use, took him to his fifth floor cell and to the
            assembly room in the basement for lineups and the Friday night news conference.
            		
            		
            		On most occasions, Oswald's escort of three to six detectives and policemen had to push their way through the
            newsmen who sought to surround them. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2631, p. 205.) Although
            the Dallas press normally did not take pictures of a prisoner without first obtaining
            permission of the police, who generally asked the prisoner, this practice was not
            followed by any of the newsmen with Oswald. Generally when Oswald appeared the newsmen turned their cameras on him, thrust microphones at his face,
            and shouted
            
            		Page 207
            		
            		
            		This page reproduces COMMISSION EXHIBIT No. 2965: Oswald at Press Conference in Assembly Room, Friday Night
            
            		Page 208
            		
            		
            		questions at him. Sometimes he answered. Reporters in the forefront of the throng
            would repeat his answers for the benefit of those behind them who could not hear.
            On Saturday, however in response to police admonitions, the reporters exercised more
            restraint and shouted fewer questions at Oswald when he passed through the corridor.
            
            		Oswald's most prolonged exposure occurred at the midnight press conference on Friday night.
            In response to demands of newsmen, District Attorney Wade, after consulting with Chief
            Curry and Captain Fritz, had announced shortly before midnight that Oswald would appear at a press conference in the basement assembly room. An estimated 70
            to 100 people, including Jack Ruby, and other unauthorized persons, crowded into the
            small downstairs room. No identification was required. The room was so packed that
            Deputy Chief M. W. Stevenson and Captain Fritz who came down to the basement after
            the crowd had assembled could not get in and were forced to remain in the doorway.
            
            		Oswald was brought into the room shortly after midnight. Curry had instructed policemen
            not to permit newsmen to touch Oswald or get close to him, but no steps were taken to shield Oswald from the crowd. Captain Fritz had asked that Oswald be placed on the platform used for lineups so that he could be more easily removed
            "if anything happened." 89 Chief Curry, however, insisted that Oswald stand on the floor in front of the stage, where he was also in front of the one-way
            nylon-cloth screen customarily used to prevent a suspect from seeing those present
            in the room. This was done because cameramen had told Curry that their cameras would
            not photograph well through the screen.
            		
            		
            		Curry had instructed the reporters that they were not to "ask any questions and
            try to interview ... [Oswald] in any way," but when he was brought into the room, immediately they began to shoot
            questions at him and shove microphones into his face." 91 It was difficult to hear
            Oswald's answers above the uproar. Cameramen stood on the tables to take pictures and others
            pushed forward to get close-ups. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2965, p. 207.) The noise
            and confusion mounted as reporters shouted at each other to get out of the way and
            cameramen made frantic efforts to get into position for pictures. After Oswald had been in the room only a few minutes, Chief Curry intervened and directed that
            Oswald be taken back to the jail because, he testified, the newsmen "tried to overrun him."
            93 THE ABORTIVE TRANSFER
            		
            		
            		In Dallas, after a person is charged with a felony, the county sheriff ordinarily
            takes custody of the prisoner and assumes responsibility for his safekeeping. Normally,
            the Dallas Police Department notifies the sheriff when a prisoner has been charged
            with a felony and the sheriff dispatches his deputies to transport the accused to
            the county jail. This is usually done within a few hours after the complaint
            
            		Page 209
            		
            		
            		has been filed. In cases of unusual importance, however, the Dallas city police
            sometimes transport the prisoners to the county jail.
            		
            		
            		The decision to move Oswald to the county jail on Sunday morning was reached by Chief Curry the preceding evening.
            Sometime after 7:30 Saturday evening, according to Assistant Chief Batchelor, two
            reporters told him that they wanted to go out to dinner but that "they didn't want
            to miss anything if we were going to move the prisoner." Curry came upon them at that
            point and told the two newsmen that if they returned by 10 o'clock in the morning,
            they wouldn't "miss anything." 95 A little later, after checking with Captain Fritz,
            Curry made a similar announcement to the assembled reporters. Curry reported the making
            of his decision to move Oswald as follows:
            		
            		Then, I talked to Fritz about when he thought he would transfer the prisoner, and
            he didn't think it was a good idea to transfer him at night because of the fact you
            couldn't see, and if anybody tried to cause them any trouble, they needed to see who
            they were and where it was coming from and so forth, and he suggested that we wait
            until daylight, so this was normal procedure, I mean, for Fritz to determine when
            he is going to transfer his prisoners, so I told him "Okay." I asked him, I said,
            "What time do you think you will be ready tomorrow?" And he didn't know exactly and
            I said, "Do you think about 10 o'clock," and he said, "I believe so," and then is
            when I went out and told the newspaper people ... "I believe if you are back here
            by 10 o'clock you will be back in time to observe anything you care to observe." 96
            		
            			During the night, between 2:30 and 3 a.m., the local office of the FBI and the sheriff's office received telephone calls from
            an unidentified man who warned that a committee had decided "to kill the man that
            killed the President." 97 Shortly after, an FBI agent notified the Dallas police of
            the anonymous threat. The police department and ultimately Chief Curry were informed
            of both threats.
            		
            		
            			Immediately after his arrival at the building on Sunday morning between 8:30 and 8:45 a.m., Curry spoke by telephone with Sheriff J. E. Decker about the transfer. When Decker
            indicated that he would leave to Curry the decision on whether the sheriff's office
            or the police would move Oswald, Curry decided that the police would handle it because "we had so much involved here,
            we were the ones that were investigating the case and we had the officers set up down
            stairs to handle it." 99
            		
            		
            		After talking with Decker, Curry began to discuss plans for the transfer. With the
            threats against Oswald in mind, Curry suggested to Batchelor and Deputy Chief Stevenson that Oswald be transported to the county jail in an armored truck, to which they agreed. While
            Batchelor made arrangements to have an armored truck brought to the building, Curry
            and Stevenson tentatively agreed on the route the armored truck would follow from
            the building to the county jail.
            
            		Page 210
            		
            		
            		Curry decided that Oswald would leave the building via the basement. He stated later that he reached this decision
            shortly after his arrival at the police building Sunday morning, when members of the
            press had already begun to gather in the basement. There is no evidence that anyone
            opposed this decision. Two members of the Dallas police did suggest to Captain Fritz
            that Oswald be taken from the building by another exit, leaving the press "waiting in the basement
            and on Commerce Street, and we could be to the county jail before anyone knew what
            was taking place." 102 However, Fritz said that he did not think Curry would agree
            to such a plan because he had promised that Oswald would be transferred at a time when newsmen could take pictures. Forrest Sorrels
            also suggested to Fritz that Oswald be moved at an unannounced time when no one was around, but Fritz again responded
            that Curry "wanted to go along with the press and not try to put anything over on
            them." 104
            		
            		
            		Preliminary arrangements to obtain additional personnel to assist with the transfer
            were begun Saturday evening. On Saturday night, the police reserves were requested
            to provide 8 to 10 men on Sunday, and additional reservists were sought in the morning.
            Capt. C. E. Talbert, who was in charge of the patrol division for the city of Dallas
            on the morning of November 24, retained a small number of policemen in the building when he took charge that morning
            and later ordered other patrolmen from several districts to report to the basement.
            106 At about 9 a.m. Deputy Chief Stevenson instructed all detectives within the building to remain for
            the transfer. Sheriff Decker testified that his men were ready to receive Oswald at the county jail from the early hours of Sunday morning.
            		
            		
            		With the patrolmen and reserve policemen available to him, Captain Talbert, on his
            own initiative, undertook to secure the basement of the police department building.
            He placed policemen outside the building at the top of the Commerce Street ramp to
            keep all spectators on the opposite side of Commerce Street. Later, Talbert directed
            that patrolmen be assigned to all street intersections the transfer vehicle would
            cross along the route to the county jail. 109 His most significant security precautions,
            however, were steps designed to exclude unauthorized persons from the basement area.
            		
            		
            		The spacious basement of the Police and Courts Building contains, among other things,
            the jail office and the police garage. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2179, p. 211.)
            The jail office, into which the jail elevator opens, is situated on the west side
            of an auto ramp cutting across the length of the basement from Main Street, on the
            north side of the building, to Commerce Street, on the south side. From the foot of
            this ramp, on the east side, midway through the basement, a decline runs down a short
            distance to the L-shaped police garage. In addition to the auto ramp, five doors to
            the garage provide access to the basement from the Police and Courts Building on the
            west side of the garage and the attached Municipal Building on the east. Three of
            these five doors provide access to three elevators opening into the garage, two for
            passengers near the central part of the garage and
            
            		Page 211

            		one for service at the east end of the garage. A fourth door near the passenger
            elevator opens into the municipal building; the fifth door, at the Commerce Street
            side of the garage, opens into a subbasement that is connected with both buildings.
            		
            		
            		Shortly after 9 o'clock Sunday morning, policemen cleared the basement of all but
            police personnel. Guards were stationed at the top of the Main and Commerce Streets
            auto ramps leading down into the basement, at each of the five doorways into the garage,
            and at the double doors leading to the public hallway adjacent to the jail office.
            Then, Sgt. Patrick T. Dean, acting under instructions from Talbert, directed 14 men
            in a search of the garage. Maintenance workers were directed to leave the area. The
            searchers examined the rafters, tops of air conditioning ducts, and every closet and
            room opening off the garage. They searched the interior and trunk compartment of automobiles
            parked in the garage. The two passenger elevators in the central part of the garage
            were not in service and the doors were shut and locked; the service elevator was moved
            to the first floor, and the operator was instructed not to return it to the basement.
            		
            		
            		Despite the thoroughness with which the search was conducted, there still existed
            one and perhaps two weak points in controlling access to the garage. Testimony did
            not resolve positively whether or not the stairway door near the public elevators
            was locked both from the inside and outside as was necessary to secure it effectively.
            And although guards were stationed near the double doors, the hallway near the jail
            office was accessible to people from inside the Police and Courts Building without
            the necessity of presenting identification. Until seconds before Oswald was shot, newsmen hurrying to photograph Oswald were able to run without challenge through those doors into the basement.
            		
            		
            		After the search had been completed, the police allowed news representatives to
            reenter the basement area and gather along the entrance to the garage on the east
            side of the ramp. Later, the police permitted the newsmen to stand in front of the
            railing on the east side of the ramp leading to Main Street. The policemen deployed
            by Talbert and Dean had instructions to allow no one but identified news media representatives
            into the basement. As before, the police accepted any credentials that appeared authentic,
            though some officers did make special efforts to check for pictures and other forms
            of corroborating identification. Many newsmen reported that they were checked on more
            than one occasion while they waited in the basement. A small number did not recall
            that their credentials were ever checked.
            		
            		
            		Shortly after his arrival on Sunday morning, Chief Curry issued instructions to
            keep reporters and cameramen out of the jail office and to keep television equipment
            behind the railing separating the basement auto ramp from the garage. Curry observed
            that in other respects Captain Talbert appeared to have security measures in hand
            and allowed him to proceed on his own initiative. Batchelor and
            
            		Page 213
            		
            		
            		Stevenson checked progress in the basement during the course of the morning, and
            the officials were generally satisfied with the steps Talbert had taken.
            		
            		
            		At about 11 a.m., Deputy Chief Stevenson requested that Capt. O. A. Jones of the forgery bureau bring
            all available detectives from the third floor offices to the basement. Jones instructed
            the detectives who accompanied him to the basement to line the walls on either side
            of the passageway cleared for the transfer party. According to Detective T. D. McMillon,
            		... Captain Jones explained to us that, when they brought the prisoner out, that
            he wanted two lines formed and we were to keep these two lines formed: you know, a
            barrier on either side of them, kind of an aisle ... for them to walk through, and
            when they came down this aisle, we were to keep this line intact and move along with
            them until the man was placed in the car.
            		
            		With Assistant Chief Batchelor's permission, Jones removed photographers who had
            gathered once again in the basement jail office. Jones recalled that he instructed
            all newsmen along the Main Street ramp to remain behind an imaginary line extending
            from the southeast corner of the jail office to the railing on the east side of the
            ramp; other officers recalled that Jones directed the newsmen to move away from the
            foot of the Main Street ramp and to line up against the east railing. In any event,
            newsmen were allowed to congregate along the foot of the ramp after Batchelor observed
            that there was insufficient room along the east of the ramp to permit all the news
            representatives to see Oswald as he was brought out.
            		
            		
            		By the time Oswald reached the basement, 40 to 50 newsmen and 70 to 75 police officers were assembled
            there. Three television cameras stood along the railing and most of the newsmen were
            congregated in that area and at the top of the adjacent decline leading into the garage.
            A group of newsmen and police officers, best estimated at about 20, stood strung across
            the bottom of the Main Street ramp. Along the south wall of the passageway outside
            the jail office door were about eight detectives, and three detectives lined the north
            wall. Two officers stood in front of the double doors leading into the passageway
            from the corridor next to the jail office. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2634, p. 214.)
            		
            		
            		Beginning Saturday night, the public had been kept informed of the approximate time
            of the transfer. At approximately 10:20 a.m. Curry told a press conference that Oswald would be moved in an armored truck and gave a general description of other security
            precautions. Apparently no newsmen were informed of the transfer route, however, and
            the route was not disclosed to the driver of the armored truck until the truck arrived
            at the Commerce Street exit at about 11:07 a.m.121 When they learned of its arrival, many of the remaining newsmen who had waited
            on the third floor descended to the basement. Shortly after, newsmen may have had
            another indication

            		that the transfer was imminent if they caught a glimpse through the glass windows
            of Oswald putting on a sweater in Captain Fritz' office. 122
            		
            		
            		Because the driver feared that the truck might stall if it had to start from the
            bottom of the ramp and because the overhead clearance appeared to be inadequate, Assistant
            Chief Batchelor had it backed only into the entranceway at the top of the ramp. Batchelor
            and others then inspected the inside of the truck.
            		
            		
            		When Chief Curry learned that the truck had arrived, he informed Captain Fritz that
            security controls were in effect and inquired how long the questioning of Oswald would continue. At this point, Fritz learned for the first time of the plan to convey
            Oswald by armored truck and immediately expressed his disapproval. He urged the use of an
            unmarked police car driven by a police officer, pointing out that this would be better
            from the standpoint of both speed and maneuverability. Curry agreed to Fritz' plan;
            the armored truck would be used as a decoy. They decided that the armored truck would
            leave the ramp first, followed by a car which would contain only security officers.
            A police car bearing Oswald would follow. After proceeding one block, the car with Oswald would turn off and proceed directly to the county jail; the armored truck would follow
            a lead car to the jail along the previously agreed upon and more circuitous route.
            		
            		
            		Captain Fritz instructed Detectives C. W. Brown and C. N. Dhority and a third detective
            to proceed to the garage and move the follow-up car and the transfer car into place
            on the auto ramp. He told Lt. Rio S. Pierce to obtain another automobile from the
            basement and take up a lead position on Commerce Street. Deputy Chief Stevenson went
            back to the basement to inform Batchelor and Jones of the change in plans. Oswald was given his sweater, and then his right hand was handcuffed to the left hand of
            Detective J. R. Leavelle. Detective T. L. Baker called the jail office to check on
            security precautions in the basement and notify officials that the prisoner was being
            brought down.
            		
            		
            		On arriving in the basement, Pierce asked Sgts. James A. Putnam and Billy Joe Maxey
            to accompany him in the lead car. Since the armored truck was blocking the Commerce
            Street ramp, it would be necessary to drive out the Main Street ramp and circle the
            block to Commerce Street. Maxey sat on the back seat of Pierce's car, and Putnam helped
            clear a path through reporters on the ramp so that Pierce could drive up toward Main
            Street. When the car passed by the reporters at about 11:20 a.m., Putnam entered the car on the right front side. Pierce drove to the top of the Main
            Street ramp and slowed momentarily as Patrolman Roy E. Vaughn stepped from his position
            at the top of the ramp toward the street to watch for traffic. After Pierce's car
            left the garage area, Brown drove another police car out of the garage, moved part
            way up the Commerce Street ramp, and began to back down into position to receive Oswald. Dhority also proceeded to drive the follow-up car into position ahead of Brown.
            
            		Page 216
            		
            		
            		As Pierce's car started up the ramp at about 11:20 a.m., Oswald, accompanied by Captain Fritz and four detectives, arrived at the jail office. Cameramen
            in the hallway of the basement took pictures of Oswald through the interior glass windows of the jail office as he was led through the office
            to the exit. Some of these cameramen then ran through the double doors near the jail
            office and squeezed into the line which had formed across the Main Street ramp. Still
            others remained just inside the double doors or proceeded through the double doors
            after Oswald and his escort emerged from the jail office. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2177, p.
            217.)
            		
            		
            		When Fritz came to the jail office door, he asked if everything was ready, and a
            detective standing in the passageway answered yes. Someone shouted, "Here he comes!";
            additional spotlights were turned on in the basement, and the din increased. A detective
            stepped from the jail office and proceeded toward the transfer car. Seconds later
            Fritz and then Oswald, with Detective Leavelle at his right, Detective L. C. Graves at his left, and Detective
            L. D. Montgomery at his rear, came through the door. Fritz walked to Brown's car,
            which had not yet backed fully into position; Oswald followed a few feet behind. Newsmen near the double door moved forward after him.
            Though movie films and video tapes indicate that the front line newsmen along the
            Main Street ramp remained fairly stationary, it was the impression of many who were
            close to the scene that with Oswald's appearance the crowd surged forward. According to Detective Montgomery, who was walking
            directly behind Oswald, soon as we came out this door ... this bunch here just moved in on us." 136 To Detective
            B. H. Combest, standing on the Commerce Street side of the passageway from the jail
            office door, it appeared that
            		
            		Almost the whole line of people pushed forward when Oswald started to leave the jail office, the door, the hall--all the newsmen were poking
            their sound mikes across to him and asking questions, and they were everyone sticking
            their flashbulbs up and around and over him and in his face.
            		
            		After Oswald had moved about 10 feet from the door of the jail office, Jack Ruby passed between
            a newsman and a detective at the edge of the straining crowd on the Main Street ramp.
            With his right hand extended and holding a . caliber revolver, Ruby stepped quickly
            forward and fired a single fatal bullet into Oswald's abdomen. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2636, p. 218.)
            		
            		
            		POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO JACK RUBY IN ENTERING THE BASEMENT
            		
            		
            		The killing of Lee Harvey Oswald in the basement of police headquarters in the midst of more than 70 police officers
            gave rise to

            		immediate speculation that one or more members of the police department provided
            Jack Ruby assistance which had enabled him to enter the basement and approach within
            a few feet of the accused Presidential assassin. In chapter VI, the Commission has
            considered whether there is any evidence linking Jack Ruby with a conspiracy to kill
            the President. At this point, however, it is appropriate to consider whether there
            is evidence that Jack Ruby received assistance from Dallas policemen or others in
            gaining access to the basement on the morning of November 24. An affirmative answer would require that the evidence be evaluated for possible
            connection with the assassination itself. While the Commission has found no evidence
            that Ruby received assistance from any person in entering the basement, his means
            of entry is significant in evaluating the adequacy of the precautions taken to protect
            Oswald.
            		
            		
            		Although more than a hundred policemen and newsmen were present in the basement
            of police headquarters during the 10 minutes before the shooting of Oswald, none has been found who definitely observed Jack Ruby's entry into the basement.
            After considering all the evidence, the Commission has concluded that Ruby entered
            the basement unaided, probably via the Main Street ramp, and no more than 3 minutes
            before the shooting of Oswald.
            		
            		
            		Ruby's account of how he entered the basement by the Main Street ramp merits consideration
            in determining his means of entry. Three Dallas policemen testified that approximately
            80 minutes after his arrest, Ruby told them that he had walked to the top of the Main
            Street ramp from the nearby Western Union office and that he walked down the ramp
            at the time the police car driven by Lieutenant Pierce emerged into Main Street. This
            information did not come to light immediately because the policemen did not report
            it to their superiors until some days later. Ruby refused to discuss his means of
            entry in interrogations with other investigators later on the day of his arrest. Thereafter,
            in a lengthy interview on December 21 and in a sworn deposition taken after his trial, Ruby gave the same explanation he
            had given to the three policemen.
            		
            		
            		The Commission has been able to establish with precision the time of certain events
            leading up to the. shooting. Minutes before Oswald appeared in the basement, Ruby was in the Western Union office located on the same
            block of Main Street some 350 feet from the top of the Main Street ramp. The time
            stamp on a money order which he sent and on the receipt found in his pocket establish
            that the order was accepted for transmission at almost exactly 11:17 a.m. Ruby was then observed to depart the office walking in the direction of the police
            building. Video tapes taken without interruption before the shooting establish that
            Lieutenant Pierce's car cleared the crowd at the foot of the ramp 55 seconds before
            the shooting. They also show Ruby standing at the foot of the ramp on the Main Street
            side before the shooting. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2635, p. 220.) The shooting
            occurred very close to 11:21 a.m. This time has been established by observing the time on a clock appearing in motion

            		of Oswald in the basement jail office, and by records giving the time of Oswald's departure from the city jail and the time at which an ambulance was summoned for
            Oswald.
            		
            		
            		The Main Street ramp provided the most direct route to the basement from the Western
            Union office. At normal stride, it requires approximately 1 minute to walk from that
            office to the top of the Main Street ramp and about 20-25 seconds to descend the ramp.
            It is certain, therefore, that Ruby entered the basement no more than 2-3 minutes
            before the shooting. This timetable indicates that a little more than 2 of the 4 minutes
            between Ruby's departure from the Western Union office and the time of the shooting
            are unaccounted for. Ruby could have consumed this time in loitering along the way,
            at the top of the ramp, or inside the basement. However, if Ruby is correct that he
            passed Pierce's car at the top of the ramp, he could have been in the basement no
            more than 30 seconds before the shooting.
            		
            		
            		The testimony of two witnesses partially corroborates Ruby's claim that he entered
            by the Main Street ramp. James Turner, an employee of WBAP-TV Fort Worth, testified
            that while he was standing near the railing on the east side of the Main Street ramp,
            perhaps 30 seconds before the shooting, he observed a man he is confident was Jack
            Ruby moving slowly down the Main Street ramp about 10 feet from the bottom. Two other
            witnesses testified that they thought they had seen Ruby on the Main Street side of
            the ramp before the shooting.
            		
            		
            		One other witness has testified regarding the purported movements of a man on the
            Main Street ramp, but his testimony merits little credence. A former police officer,
            N.J. Daniels, who was standing at the top of the ramp with the single patrolman guarding
            this entrance, R. E. Vaughn, testified that "3 or 4 minutes, I guess" 150 before the
            shooting, a man walked down the Main Street ramp in full view of Vaughn but was not
            stopped or questioned by the officer. Daniels did not identify the man as Ruby. Moreover,
            he gave a description which differed in important respects from Ruby's appearance
            on November 24, and he has testified that he doesn't think the man was Ruby. On November 24, Vaughn telephoned Daniels to ask him if he had seen anybody walk past him on the
            morning of the 24th and was told that he had not; it was not until November 29 that Daniels came forward with the statement that he had seen a man enter.
            		
            		
            		Although the sum of this evidence tends to support Ruby's claim that he entered
            by the Main Street ramp, there is other evidence not fully consistent with Ruby's
            story. Patrolman Vaughn stated that he checked the credentials of all unknown persons
            seeking to enter the basement, and his testimony was supported by several persons.
            Vaughn denied that the emergence of Lieutenant Pierce's car from the building distracted
            him long enough to allow Ruby to enter the ramp unnoticed, and neither he nor any
            of the three officers in Lieutenant Pierce's car saw Ruby enter.
            
            		Page 222
            		
            		
            		Despite Vaughn's denial the Commission has found no credible evidence to support
            any other entry route. Two Dallas detectives believed they observed three men pushing
            a WBAP-TV camera into the basement minutes before the shooting, while only two were
            with the camera after Oswald had been shot. However, films taken in the basement show the WBAP-TV camera being
            pushed past the detectives by only two men. The suspicion of the detectives is probably
            explained by testimony that a third WBAP-TV employee ran to help steady the incoming
            camera as it entered the basement, probably just before the camera became visible
            on the films. Moreover, since the camera entered the basement close to 4 minutes before
            the shooting,158 it is virtually impossible that Ruby could have been in the basement
            at that time.
            		
            		
            		The possibility that Ruby entered the basement by some other route has been investigated,
            but the Commission has found no evidence to support it. Ruby could have walked from
            the Western Union office to the Commerce Street ramp on the other side of the building
            in about 2 and a half minutes. 159 However, during the minutes preceding the shooting
            video tapes show the armored truck in the entranceway to this ramp with only narrow
            clearance on either side. (See Commission Exhibit. No. 2710, p. 223.) Several policemen
            were standing near the truck and a large crowd of spectators was gathered across the
            street. It is improbable that Ruby could have squeezed past the truck without having
            been observed. If Ruby entered by any other means, he would have had to pass first
            through the Police and Courts Building or the attached Municipal Building, and then
            secondly through one of the five doors into the basement, all of which, according
            to the testimony of police officers, were secured. The testimony was not completely
            positive about one of the doors.
            		
            		
            		There is no evidence to support the speculations that Ruby used a press badge to
            gain entry to the basement or that he concealed himself in a police car. Police found
            no form of press card on Ruby's person after his apprehension, nor any discarded badges
            within the basement. There is no evidence that any police officer admitted Ruby on
            the pretense that he was a member of the press or any other pretense.
            		
            		
            		Police vehicles in the basement were inspected during the course of the search supervised
            by Sergeant Dean. According to Patrolman Vaughn, the only vehicles that entered the
            basement while he was at the top of the Main Street ramp were two patrol cars, one
            of which entered twice, and a patrol wagon which was searched by another policeman
            after it entered the basement. All entered on official police business and considerably
            more than 4 minutes before Oswald was shot. None of the witnesses at the top of the Main Street ramp recalled any police
            car entering the basement in the 4-minute period after Ruby left the Western Union
            office and preceding the shooting. The possibility that Ruby could have entered the
            basement in a car may therefore be completely discounted.

            		Page 224
            		
            		
            		The Dallas Police Department, concerned at the failure of its security measures,
            conducted an extensive investigation that revealed no information indicating complicity
            between any police officer and Jack Ruby. Ruby denied to the Commission that he received
            any form of assistance. The FBI interviewed every member of the police department
            who was on duty in the basement on November 24, and Commission staff members took sworn depositions from many. With few exceptions,
            newsmen who were present in the basement at the time also gave statements and/or depositions.
            As the record before the Commission indicated, Ruby had rather free access to the
            Dallas police quarters during the period subsequent to the assassination, but there
            was no evidence that implicated the police or newsmen in Ruby's actions on that day.
            		
            		
            		Ruby was known to have a wide acquaintanceship with Dallas policemen and to seek
            their favor. According to testimony from many sources, he gave free coffee at his
            clubs to many policemen while they were on duty and free admittance and discounts
            on beverages when they were off duty. Although Chief Curry's estimate that approximately
            25 to 50 of the 1,175 men in the Dallas Police Department knew Ruby 171 may be too
            conservative, the Commission found no evidence of any suspicious relationships between
            Ruby and any police officer.
            		
            		
            		The Commission found no substantial evidence that any member of the Dallas Police
            Department recognized Jack Ruby as an unauthorized person in the basement prior to
            the time Sgt. P. T. Dean, according to his testimony, saw Ruby dart forward toward
            Oswald. But Dean was then part way up the Commerce Street ramp, too far removed to act.
            Patrolman W. J. Harrison, Capt. Glen King, and reserve officers Capt. C. O. Arnett
            and Patrolman W. M. Croy were among those in front of Ruby at the time Dean saw him.
            They all faced away from Ruby, toward the jail office. Video tapes show that Harrison
            turned in the direction of the ramp at the time Lieutenant Pierce's car passed, and
            once again 25 seconds later, but there is no indication that he observed or recognized
            Ruby. The policemen standing on the south side of the passageway from the jail office,
            who might have been looking in Ruby's direction, had the glare of television and photographer's
            lights in their eyes.
            		
            		
            		The Commission also considered the possibility that a member of the police department
            called Ruby at his apartment and informed him, either intentionally or unintentionally,
            of the time of the planned transfer. From at least 10:19 a.m., until close to 11 a.m., on Sunday, Ruby was at his apartment,176 where he could have received a call that
            the transfer was imminent. He apparently left his apartment between 10:45 and 11 a.m.177 However, the drive from Ruby's apartment to the Western Union office takes approximately
            15 minutes. Since the time of the contemplated transfer could not have been known
            to anyone until a few minutes before 11:15 a.m., a precise time could not have been conveyed to Ruby while he was at his apartment.
            Moreover, the television and radio publicized
            
            		Page 225
            		
            		
            		the transfer plans throughout the morning, obviating the need for Ruby to obtain
            information surreptitiously.
            		
            		
            		ADEQUACY OF SECURITY PRECAUTIONS
            		
            		
            		The shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald obviously resulted from the failure of the security precautions which the Dallas
            Police Department had taken to protect their prisoner. In assessing the causes of
            the security failure, the Commission has not overlooked the extraordinary circumstances
            which prevailed during the. days that the attention of the world was turned on Dallas.
            Confronted with a unique situation, the Dallas police took special security measures
            to insure Oswald's safety. Unfortunately these did not include adequate control of the great crowd of
            newsmen that inundated the police department building.
            		
            		
            		The Dallas police had in custody a man whose alleged act had brought upon him immediate
            and universal opprobrium. There were many possible reasons why people might have attempted
            to kill him if given the opportunity. Concerned that there might be an attempt on
            Oswald's life, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover sent a message to Chief Curry on November 22 through Special Agent Manning C. Clements of the FBI's Dallas office, urging that
            Oswald be afforded the utmost security. Curry does not recall receiving the message.
            		
            		
            		Although the presence of a great mass of press representatives created an extraordinary
            security problem in the building, the police department pursued its normal policy
            of admitting the press. That policy, set forth in General Order No. 81 of the Dallas
            Police Department, provided--
            		... that members of this Department render every assistance, except such as obviously
            may seriously hinder or delay the proper functioning of the Department, to the accredited
            members of the official news-gathering agencies and this includes newspaper, television
            cameramen and news-reel photographers.
            		
            		In a letter to all members of the police department, dated February 7, 1963, Chief
            Curry explained the general order, in part, as follows:
            		
            		
            		The General Order covering this subject is not merely permissive. It does not state
            that the Officer may, if he so chooses, assist the press. It rather places on him
            a responsibility to lend active assistance.
            		°     °     °     °     °
            		... as a Department we deal with public affairs. It is the right of the public to
            know about these affairs, and one of the most accurate and useful avenues we have
            of supplying this information is through the newspapers and radio and television stations.
            		
            		Implied in the General Order is a prohibition for the Officer to improperly attempt
            to interfere with the news media representative,
            
            		Page 226
            		
            		
            		who is functioning in his capacity as such. Such activity on the part of any Police
            Officer is regarded by the press as an infringement of rights, and the Department
            shares this view.
            		
            		
            		Under this policy, news representatives ordinarily had access to the Police and
            Courts Building. The first newsmen to arrive on Friday afternoon were admitted in
            accordance with the policy; others who came later simply followed behind them. Shortly
            after Oswald arrived, Captain King granted permission to bring television cameras to the third
            floor. By the time the unwieldy proportions of the crowd of newsmen became apparent,
            it had already become well entrenched on the third floor. No one suggested reversing
            the department's policy expressed in General Order No. 81. Chief Curry testified that
            at no time did he consider clearing the crowd from the building; he "saw no particular
            harm in allowing the media to observe the prisoner." 183 Captain King later stated
            candidly that he simply became "accustomed to the idea of them being out there." 184
            		
            		
            		The general policy of the Dallas police recognized that the rule of full cooperation
            did not apply when it might jeopardize an investigation. In retrospect, most members
            of the department believed that the general rule allowing admittance of the press
            to the police quarters should not have been followed after the assassination. Few,
            if any, thought this at the time. By failing to exclude the press from the building
            on Friday and Saturday, the Dallas police made it possible for the uncontrolled crowd
            to nearly surround Oswald on the frequent occasions that he moved through the third floor corridor. The decision
            to allow newsmen to observe the transfer on Sunday followed naturally the policy established
            during these first 2 days of Oswald's detention. The reporters and cameramen descended upon the third floor of the Police
            and Courts Building in such numbers that the pressroom on the third floor proved wholly
            inadequate. Rather than the "two or three or maybe a half dozen reporters" who normally
            appeared to cover local police stories, 187 the police were faced with upward of 100.
            Bringing with them cameras, microphones, cables, and spotlights, the newsmen inevitably
            spilled over into areas where they interfered with the transaction of police business
            and the maintenance of security.
            		
            		
            		Aside from numbers, the gathering of reporters presented a problem because most
            of them were representatives of the national and foreign press, rather than the local
            press. These newsmen carried individual press cards rather than identification cards
            issued by the Dallas police. Therefore, it was impossible for the police to verify
            quickly the identity of this great number of unfamiliar people who appeared almost
            simultaneously. Because of the close physical proximity of the milling mass of insistent
            newsmen to the prisoner, the failure to authenticate press credentials subjected the
            prisoner to a serious security risk.
            		
            		
            		Although steps were taken on Friday afternoon to insure that persons seeking entry
            to the third floor were there for a legitimate purpose,
            
            		Page 227
            		
            		
            		reasons could be fabricated. Moreover, because of the large crowd, it was easier
            for unauthorized persons to slip by those guarding the entrances. Jack Ruby, for one,
            was able to gain entry to the third-floor corridor on Friday night.
            		
            		
            		The third-floor corridor provided the only passageway between the homicide and robbery
            bureau and the jail elevator. No thought seems to have been given, however, to the
            possibility of questioning Oswald on some other floor. Moreover, Oswald's most extended exposure to the press, at the Friday evening press conference, was
            unrelated to any phase of the investigation and was motivated primarily by the desire
            to satisfy the demands of the news media to see the prisoner. The risks attendant
            upon this appearance were emphasized by the presence of unauthorized persons, including
            Jack Ruby, at the press conference in the basement assembly room.
            		
            		
            		Although Oswald was repeatedly exposed to possible assaults on Friday and Saturday, he met his death
            on Sunday, when police took the most extensive security precautions. The assembly
            of more than 70 police officers, some of them armed with tear gas, and the contemplated
            use of an armored truck, appear to have been designed primarily to repel an attempt
            of a mob to seize the prisoner. Chief Curry's own testimony indicated that such a
            focus resulted not from any appraisal of the varied risks to Oswald's life but came about in response to the telephone threat Sunday morning that a hundred
            men were going to attack Oswald.
            		
            		
            		A more balanced appraisal would have given thought to protection against any attack.
            For example, the acceptance of inadequate press credentials posed a clear avenue for
            a one-man assault. The likelihood of an unauthorized person obtaining entry by such
            means is confirmed not alone by the fact that Jack Ruby managed to get by a guard
            at one entrance. Several newsmen related that their credentials were not checked as
            they entered the basement Sunday morning. Seconds before Oswald was shot, the double doors from the hallway next to the jail office afforded a means
            of entry to the basement without presentation of credentials earlier demanded of newsmen.
            		
            		
            		The swarm of newspeople in the basement also substantially limited the ability of
            the police to detect an unauthorized person once he had entered the basement. While
            Jack Ruby might have been easily spotted if only police officers had been in the basement,198
            he remained apparently unnoticed in the crowd of newsmen until he lunged forward toward
            Oswald. The near-blinding television and motion picture lights which were allowed to shine
            upon the escort party further increased the difficulty of observing unusual movements
            in the basement. Moreover, by making public the plans for the transfer, the police
            attracted to the city jail many persons who otherwise might not have learned of the
            move until it had been completed. This group included the onlookers gathered on Commerce
            Street and a few people on Main Street. Also, continuous television and radio coverage
            of
            
            		Page 228
            		
            		
            		the activities in the basement might have resulted in compromise of the transfer
            operation.
            		
            		
            		These risks to Oswald's safety, growing in part out of adherence to the general policy of the police department,
            were also accepted for other reasons. Many members of the police department believed
            that the extraordinary public attention aroused by the tragic death of President Kennedy obliged them to make special efforts to accommodate the press. Captain King carefully
            articulated one reason why the newsmen were permitted
            		... to remain in the hallways, ... to view the investigation and to keep in constant
            touch with progress of the investigation.

            		We realized that if we arrested a suspect, that if we brought him into the police
            station and then conducted all of our investigations behind closed doors, that if
            we gave no reports on the progress of our investigation and did not permit the newsmen
            to see the suspect--if we excluded them from it--we would leave ourselves open not
            only to criticisms that we were fabricating a suspect and were attempting to pin something
            on someone, but even more importantly, we would cause people to lose faith in our
            fairness and, through losing faith in our fairness, to lose faith to a certain extent
            in the processes of law.
            		
            		We felt it was mandatory that as many people knew about it as possible. We knew,
            too, that if we did exclude the newsmen, we would be leaving ourselves open to a charge
            that we were using improper action, duress, physical abuse, all of these things.
            		
            		While Oswald was in custody, the Dallas police kept the press informed about the treatment Oswald was receiving. The public could have been assured that the prisoner was not mistreated
            and that his rights were fully respected by the police, without each one of hundreds
            of cameramen and reporters being permitted to satisfy himself that the police had
            not abused the prisoner. This result could have been accomplished by obtaining reports
            from members of the family who visited him, or by a committee of the bar or other
            substantial citizens of the community. When it became known on Saturday that Oswald did not have an attorney, the president of the Dallas Bar Association visited him
            to inquire whether he wished assistance in obtaining counsel.
            		
            		
            		Moreover, the right of the public to know does not give the press license to interfere
            with the efficient operation of law-enforcement agencies. Permitting the press to
            remain on the third floor of the building served no valid purpose that could not have
            been met if the press had been excluded from the third floor, as it was from the fourth
            and fifth floors, and informed of developments either through press releases or at
            press conferences elsewhere in the building.
            		
            		
            		Having failed to exclude the mass of the press from the basement during the transfer
            of Oswald, the police department's security measures
            
            		Page 229
            		
            		
            		could not be completely effective. Despite the pressures that prevailed, planning
            and coordination of security arrangements could have been more thorough and precise.
            No single member of the Dallas Police Department ever assumed full responsibility
            for the details of Oswald's transfer. Chief Curry participated in some of the planning, but he felt that primary
            authority for the transfer should be Fritz', since Fritz had charge of the investigation.
            According to Chief Curry--
            		
            		Fritz and I, I think, discussed this briefly, the possibility of getting that prisoner
            out of the city hall during the night hours and by another route and slipping him
            to the jail, but actually Fritz was not too much in favor of this and I more or less
            left this up to Fritz as to when and how this transfer would be made, because he has
            in the past transferred many of his prisoners to the county jail and I felt that since
            it was his responsibility, the prisoner was, to let him decide when and how he wanted
            to transfer this prisoner.
            		
            		Fritz, on the other hand, felt that Curry was directing the transfer arrangements:
            "I was transferring him like the chief told me to transfer him." 203 When Capt. W.
            B. Frazier notified Fritz by telephone early Sunday morning about the threats to Oswald's life, Fritz replied that Curry should be notified, since he was handling the transfer.
            When urged to modify the transfer plans to avoid the press, as he later testified
            he would have preferred to do, Fritz declined on the ground that Curry had already
            decided to the contrary. Hence, if the recollection of both officials is accurate,
            the basic decision to move Oswald at an announced time and in the presence of the news media was never carefully thought
            through by either man. Curry and Fritz had agreed Saturday evening that Oswald should not be moved at night, but their discussion apparently went little further.
            		
            		
            		Perhaps the members of the Dallas Police Department were, as many testified, accustomed
            to working together so that formal instructions were sometimes unnecessary. On the
            other hand, it is clear, at least in retrospect, that this particular occasion demanded
            more than the usual informal unspoken understandings. The evidence indicates that
            no member of the department at any time considered fully the implications of moving
            Oswald through the basement. Nor did any single official or group of officials coordinate
            and direct where the transfer vehicle would be stationed to accept Oswald, where the press would stand, and the number and positioning of police officers in
            the basement. Captain Jones indicated that there were to be two solid lines of policemen
            from the jail office door to the transfer vehicle, 207 but lines were formed only
            along the walls of the areaway between the jail office door and the ramp. The newsmen
            were not kept east of the auto ramp where a railing would have separated
            
            		Page 230
            		
            		
            		them from Oswald. No strong ranks of policemen were ever placed in front of the newsmen once they
            were allowed to gather in the area of the Main Street ramp. Many policemen in the
            basement did not know the function they were supposed to perform. No instructions
            were given that certain policemen should watch the crowd rather than Oswald. Apparently no one gave any thought to the blinding effect of television and other
            camera lights upon the escort party.
            		
            		
            		Largely on his own initiative, Captain Talbert undertook to secure the basement,
            with only minimal coordination with those responsible for and familiar with the route
            Oswald would take through the basement. Several officials recalled that Lt. Woodrow Wiggins
            was directed to clear the basement jail office, but Wiggins testified that he received
            no such assignment. 210 In any event, less than 20 minutes before the transfer, Captain
            Jones observed newsmen in the jail office and had them removed. But no official removed
            news personnel from the corridor beside the jail office; indeed, cameramen took pictures
            through the glass windows of the jail office as Oswald walked through it toward the basement, and then approached to within 20 feet of Oswald from the rear at the same time that Jack Ruby moved toward Oswald from the front.
            		
            		
            		A clear example of the inadequacy of coordination was the last-minute change in
            plans to transfer Oswald in an unmarked police car rather than by armored truck. The plan to use an armored
            vehicle was adopted without informing Fritz. When Fritz was told of the arrangement
            shortly after 11 o'clock, he objected, and hurried steps were taken to modify the
            arrangements. Fritz was then prematurely informed that the basement arrangements were
            complete. When Oswald and the escorting detectives entered the basement, the transfer car had not yet been
            backed into position, nor had the policemen been arranged to block the newsmen's access
            to Oswald's path. If the transfer car had been carefully positioned between the press and Oswald, Ruby might have been kept several yards from his victim and possibly without a clear
            view of him. Detective Leavelle, who accompanied Oswald into the basement, testified:
            		... I was surprised when I walked to the door and the car was not in the spot it
            should have been, but I could see it was in back, and backing into position, but had
            it been in position where we were told it would be, that would have eliminated a lot
            of the area in which anyone would have access to him, because it would have been blocked.
            by the car. In fact, if the car had been sitting where we were told it was going to
            be, see -- it would have been sitting directly upon the spot where Ruby was standing
            when he fired the shot.
            		
            		Captain Jones described the confusion with which Oswald's entry into the basement was in fact received:
            
            		Page 231
            		
            		Then the change--going to put two cars up there. There is no reason why that back
            car can't get all the way back to the jail office. The original plan would be that
            the line of officers would be from the jail door to the vehicle. Then they say, "Here
            he comes." ... It is too late to get the people out of the way of the car and form
            the line. I am aware that. Oswald is already coming because of the furor, so, I was trying to keep everybody out of
            the way and keep the way clear and I heard a shot.
            		
            		Therefore, regardless of whether the press should have been allowed to witness the
            transfer, security measures in the basement for Oswald's protection could and should have been better organized and more thorough. These additional
            deficiencies were directly related to the decision to admit newsmen to the basement.
            The Commission concludes that the failure of the police to remove Oswald secretly or to control the crowd in the basement at the time of the transfer were
            the major causes of the security breakdown which led to Oswald's death.
            		
            		
            		NEWS COVERAGE AND POLICE POLICY
            		
            		
            		Consistent with its policy of allowing news representatives to remain within the
            working quarters of the Police and Courts Building, the police department made every
            effort to keep the press fully informed about the progress of the investigation. As
            a result, from Friday afternoon until after the killing of Oswald on Sunday, the press was able to publicize virtually all of the information about
            the case which had been gathered until that time. In the process, a great deal of
            misinformation was disseminated to a worldwide audience. (For some examples see app.
            XII.)
            		
            		
            		As administrative assistant to Chief Curry, Captain King also handled departmental
            press relations and issued press releases. According to King, it was "the responsibility
            of each member of the department to furnish to the press information on incidents
            in which they, themselves, were involved, except on matters which involved ... personnel
            policies of the department, or ... unless it would obviously interfere with an investigation
            underway." 216 In Oswald's case, Chief Curry released most of the information to the press. He and Assistant
            Chief Batchelor agreed on Friday that Curry would make all announcements to the press.
            However, there is no evidence that this decision was ever communicated to the rest
            of the police force. The chief consequence appears to have been that Batchelor refrained
            from making statements to the news media during this period.
            		
            		
            		Most of the information was disclosed through informal oral statements or answers
            to questions at impromptu and clamorous press conferences in the third floor corridor.
            Written press releases were not employed. The ambulatory press conference became a
            familiar sight during these days. Whenever Curry or other officials appeared in the

            		Page 233
            		
            		
            		hallway, newsmen surrounded them, asking questions and requesting statements. Usually
            the officials complied. (See Commission Exhibit No. 2632, p. 232.)
            		
            		
            		Curry appeared in interviews on television and radio at least a dozen times during
            November 22-24. He did not attend any of the interrogations of Oswald in Captain Fritz' office except at the beginning and toward the end of Sunday morning's
            session; he received his information through Captain Fritz and other sources. Nevertheless,
            in sessions with the newsmen on Friday and Saturday he gave detailed information on
            the progress of the case against Oswald. Recorded statements of television and radio interviews with Curry and other officials
            in Dallas during November 22-24 have been transcribed and included in the record compiled by the Commission. An example
            of these interviews is the following transcript of remarks made by Curry to newsmen
            on Saturday:
            		
            		Q. Chief Curry, I understand you have some new information in this case. Could you
            relate what that is?
            		
            		
            		A. Yes, we've just been informed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that they,
            the FBI, have the order letter from a mail order house, and the order was sent to
            their laboratory in Washington and the writing on this order was compared with known
            samples of our suspect, Oswald's handwriting and found to be the same.
            		
            		
            		Q. This order was for the rifle?
            		
            		
            		A. This order was for the rifle to a mail order house in Chicago. It was [inaudible].
            The return address was to Dallas, Texas, to the post office box under the name of
            A. Hidell, H-I-D-E-double L. This is the post office box of our suspect. This gun
            was mailed parcel post March 20, 1963. I understand he left Dallas shortly after this and didn't come back until I think
            about two months ago.
            		
            		
            		Q. Do you know again on what date this rifle was ordered and 'are you able to link
            it. definitely as the rifle which you confiscated at the School Book Depository?
            		
            		
            		A. That we have not done so far. If the FBI has been able to do it I have not been
            informed of it yet. We do know that this man ordered a rifle of the type that was
            used in the assassination of the President from this mail order house in Chicago and
            the FBI has definitely identified the writing as that of our suspect.
            		
            		
            		Q. On another subject-- I understand you have photographs of the suspect, Oswald, with a rifle like that used. Could you describe that picture?
            		
            		
            		A. This is the picture of Oswald standing facing a camera with a rifle in his hand which is very similar to the rifle
            that we have in our possession. He also had a pistol strapped on his hip. He was holding
            two papers in his hand, with one of them seemed to be The Worker and the other says
            Be Militant--I don't know whether that was headlies or the name of the paper.
            		Page 234
            		
            		Q. How much did the gun cost from the mail order house?
            		
            		
            		A. I understand the gun was advertised for $12., I believe.
            		
            		
            		Q. Have you received any results on the ballistics test conducted on the gun and
            on Oswald?
            		
            		
            		A. They're going to be favorable. I don't have a formal report yet.
            		
            		
            		Q. But you are sure at this time they will be favorable?
            		
            		
            		A. Yes.
            		
            		
            		Q. Do you feel now that you have the case completely wrapped up, or are you continuing?
            		
            		
            		A. We will continue as long as there is a shred of evidence to be gathered. We have
            a strong case at this time.
            		
            		
            		Q. I believe you said earlier this afternoon that you have a new development which
            does wrap up the case--the first time you said the case definitely is secure. Is that
            correct?
            		
            		
            		A. That was this morning. This additional evidence just makes a stronger case.
            		
            		
            		Q. But this is not the same evidence you were referring to then?
            		
            		
            		A. No, that's true.
            		
            		
            		Q. Would you be willing to say what that evidence was?
            		
            		
            		A. No, sir. I don't wish to reveal it. It might jeopardize our case.
            		
            		
            		Commentator: Thank you very much Chief Jesse Curry of the Dallas Police Department.
            		
            		Although Captain Fritz permitted himself to be interviewed by the news media less
            frequently than did Chief Curry, he nevertheless answered questions and ventured opinions
            about the progress of the investigation. On Saturday he told reporters that he was
            convinced beyond a doubt that Oswald had killed the President. He discussed some of the evidence in the case, especially
            the rifle, but his contribution to the knowledge of the reporters was small compared
            with that of Chief Curry.
            		
            		
            		Many other members of the police department, including high officials, detectives,
            and patrolmen, were also interviewed by news representatives during these days. Some
            of these men had participated in specific aspects of the case, such as the capture
            of Oswald at the Texas Theatre and the search for evidence at the Texas School Book Depository
            Building. Few, if any, seemed reluctant to submit to questions and to being televised.
            It seemed to District Attorney Wade that the newsmen "just followed everybody everywhere
            they went ... they interviewed some of your patrolmen ... on the corner ... they were
            interviewing anybody." 223
            		
            		
            		Wade himself also made several statements to the press. He visited police headquarters
            twice on Friday, twice on Saturday, and twice on Sunday. On most of these occasions
            he was interviewed by the press and appeared on television. After Oswald had appeared before the press on Friday night, Wade held an
            
            		Page 235
            		
            		
            		impromptu conference with reporters in the overflowing assembly room. Wade told
            the press on Saturday that he would not reveal any evidence because it might prejudice
            the selection of a jury. On other occasions, however, he mentioned some items of evidence
            and expressed his opinions regarding Oswald's guilt. He told the press on Friday night that Oswald's wife had told the police that her husband had a rifle in the garage at the house
            in Irving and that it was missing the morning of the assassination. On one occasion
            he repeated the error that the murder rifle had been a Mauser. Another time, he stated
            his belief that Oswald had prepared for the assassination months in advance, including what he would tell
            the police. He also said that Oswald had practiced with the rifle to improve his marksmanship.
            		
            		
            		The running commentary on the investigation by the police inevitably carried with
            it the disclosure of many details that proved to be erroneous. In their efforts to
            keep the public abreast of the investigation, the police reported hearsay items and
            unverified leads; further investigation proved many of these to be incorrect or inaccurate.
            For example, the rifle found on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository
            Building was initially identified as a Mauser 7. rather than a Mannlicher-Carcano
            6. because a deputy constable who was one of the first to see it thought it looked
            like a Mauser. He neither handled the weapon nor saw it at close range.
            		
            		
            		Police sources were also responsible for the mistaken notion that the chicken bones
            found on the sixth floor were the remains of Oswald's lunch. They had in fact been left by another employee who ate his lunch there at
            least 15 minutes before the assassination. Curry repeated the erroneous report that
            a Negro had picked up Oswald near the scene of the assassination and driven him across town. It was also reported
            that the map found in Oswald's room contained a marked route of the Presidential motorcade when it actually contained
            markings of places where Oswald may have applied for jobs, including, of course, the Texas School Book Depository.
            		
            		
            		Concern about the effects of the unlimited disclosures was being voiced by Saturday
            morning. According to District Attorney Wade, he received calls from lawyers in Dallas
            and elsewhere expressing concern about providing an attorney for Oswald and about the amount of information being given to the press by the police and the
            district attorney. Curry continued to answer questions on television and radio during
            the remainder of the day and Sunday morning.
            		
            		
            		FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover became concerned because "almost as soon as ... [FBI
            Laboratory reports] would reach the Dallas Police Department, the chief of police
            or one of the representatives of the department would go on TV or radio and relate
            findings of the FBI, giving information such as the identification of the gun and
            other items of physical evidence." 234 On Sunday, after Oswald was shot, Hoover dispatched a personal message to Curry requesting him
            
            		Page 236
            
            		"not to go on the air any more until this case ... [is] resolved." Hoover testified
            later that Curry agreed not to make any more statements.
            		
            		
            		The shooting of Oswald shocked the Dallas police, and after the interviews that immediately followed the
            shooting they were disposed to remain silent. Chief Curry made only one more television
            appearance after the shooting. At 1:30 p.m., he descended to the assembly room where, tersely and grimly, he announced Oswald's death. He refused to answer any of the questions shouted at him by the persistent
            reporters, concluding the conference in less than a minute.
            		
            		
            		District Attorney Wade also held one more press conference. Before doing so on Sunday
            evening, he returned once more to the police station and held a meeting with "all
            the brass" except Curry. Wade told them that "people are saying ... you had the wrong
            man and you all were the one who killed him or let him out here to have him killed
            intentionally." Wade told the police that "somebody ought to go out in television
            and lay out the evidence that you had on Oswald, and tell them everything." He sat down and listed from memory items of evidence
            in the case against Oswald. According to Wade, Chief Curry refused to make any statements because he had told
            an FBI inspector that he would say no more. The police refused to furnish Wade with
            additional details of the case.
            		
            		
            		Wade nonetheless proceeded to hold a lengthy formal press conference that evening,
            in which he attempted to list all of the evidence that had been accumulated at that
            point tending to establish Oswald as the assassin of President Kennedy. Unfortunately, at that time, as he subsequently testified, he lacked a thorough
            grasp of the evidence and made a number of errors. He stated that Oswald had told a woman on a bus that the President had been killed, an error apparently
            caused by the busdriver having confused Oswald with another passenger who was on the bus after Oswald had left. Wade also repeated the error about Oswald's having a map marked with the route of the motorcade. He told reporters that Oswald's description and name "went out by the police to look for him." 239 The police never
            mentioned Oswald's name in their broadcast descriptions before his arrest.
            		
            		
            		Wade was innocent of one error imputed to him since November 24. The published transcript of part of the press conference furnished to newspapers
            by the Associated Press represented Wade as having identified the cabdriver who took
            Oswald to North Beckley Avenue after the shooting, as one named "Darryl Click." The transcript
            as it appeared in the New York Times and the Washington Post of November 26, reads:
            
            		
            		
            		A. [Wade] a lady. He then the bus, he asked the bus driver to stop, got off at a
            stop, caught a taxicab driver, Darryl Click. don't have his exact place--and went
            to his home in Oak Cliff, changed his clothes hurriedly, and left.
            		Page 237
            		
            		
            		The correct transcript of the press conference, taken from an audio tape supplied
            by station WBAP, Fort. Worth, is as follows:
            		
            		A. [Wade] A lady. He then--the bus, he asked the bus driver to stop, got off at
            a stop, caught a taxicab driver.
            		
            		
            		Q. Where?
            		
            		
            		A. In Oak Cliff. I don't have the exact place--and went to his home in Oak Cliff,
            changed his clothes hurriedly and left.
            		
            		In this manner, a section of Dallas, "Oak Cliff," became a nonexistent taxicab driver,
            "Darryl Click." Wade did not mention the cabdriver by name at any time. In transcribing
            the conference from the sound tape, a stenographer apparently made an error that might
            have become permanently imbedded in the literature of the event but for the preservation
            and use of an original sound tape.
            		
            		
            		Though many of the inaccuracies were subsequently corrected by the police and are
            negated by findings of the Commission included elsewhere in this report, the publicizing
            of unchecked information provided much of the basis for the myths and rumors that
            came into being soon after the President's death. The erroneous disclosures became
            the basis for distorted reconstructions and interpretations of the assassination.
            The necessity for the Dallas authorities to correct themselves or to be corrected
            by other sources gave rise not only to criticism of the police department's competence
            but also to doubts regarding the veracity of the police. Skeptics sought to cast doubt
            on much of the correct evidence later developed and to find support for their own
            theories in these early police statements.
            		
            		
            		The immediate disclosure of information by the police created a further risk of
            injuring innocent citizens by unfavorable publicity. This was the unfortunate experience
            of Joe R. Molina, a Dallas-born Navy veteran who had been employed by the Texas School
            Book Depository since 1947 and on November 22, 1963, held the position of credit manager. Apparently because of Molina's employment at
            the Depository and his membership in a veterans' organization, the American G.I. Forum,
            that the Dallas police considered possibly subversive, Dallas policemen searched Molina's
            home with his permission, at about 1:30 a.m., Saturday, November 23. During the day Molina was intermittently interrogated at police headquarters for
            6 or 7 hours, chiefly about his membership in the American G.I. Forum, and also about
            Oswald. He was never arrested, charged, or held in custody.
            		
            		
            		While Molina was being questioned, officials of the police department made statements
            or answered questions244 that provided the basis for television reports about Molina
            during the day. These reports spoke of a "second suspect being picked up," insinuated
            that the Dallas police had reason to suspect another person who worked in the Texas
            School Book Depository, stated that the suspect had been arrested and his home searched,
            and mentioned that Molina may have
            
            		Page 238
            		
            		
            		been identified by the U.S. Department of Justice as a possible subversive.
            		
            		
            		No evidence was ever presented to link Molina with Oswald except as a fellow employee of the Texas School Book Depository. According to Molina,
            he had never spoken to Oswald. The FBI notified the Commission that Molina had never been the subject of an investigation
            by it and that it had never given any information about Molina to the Dallas police
            concerning any alleged subversive activities by him. The Dallas police explained in
            a statement to the FBI that they had never had a file on Molina, but that they did
            have one on the American G.I. Forum.
            		
            		
            		Molina lost his job in December. He felt that he was being discharged because of
            the unfavorable publicity he had received, but officials of the Depository claimed
            that automation was the reason. Molina testified that he had difficulty in finding
            another position, until finally, with the help of a fellow church member, he secured
            a position at a lower salary than his previous one.
            		
            		
            		If Oswald had been tried for his murders of November 22, the effects of the news policy pursued by the Dallas authorities would have proven
            harmful both to the prosecution and the defense. The misinformation reported after
            the shootings might have been used by the defense to cast doubt on the reliability
            of the State's entire case. Though each inaccuracy can be explained without great
            difficulty, the number and variety of misstatements issued by the police shortly after
            the assassination would have greatly assisted a skillful defense attorney attempting
            to influence the attitudes of jurors.
            		
            		
            		A fundamental objection to the news policy pursued by the Dallas police, however,
            is the extent to which it endangered Oswald's constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury. Because of the nature of the
            crime, the widespread attention which it necessarily received, and the intense public
            feelings which it aroused, it would have been a most difficult task to select an unprejudiced
            jury, either in Dallas or elsewhere. But the difficulty was markedly increased by
            the divulgence of the specific items of evidence with which the police linked Oswald to the two killings. The disclosure of evidence encouraged the public, from which
            a jury would ultimately be impaneled, to prejudge the very questions that would be
            raised at trial.
            		
            		
            		Moreover, rules of law might have prevented the prosecution from presenting portions
            of this evidence to the jury. For example, though expressly recognizing that Oswald's wife could not be compelled to testify against him, District Attorney Wade revealed
            to the Nation that Marina Oswald had affirmed her husband's ownership of a rifle like that found on the sixth floor
            of the Texas School Book Depository. Curry stated that Oswald had refused to take a lie detector test, although such a statement would have been
            inadmissible in a trial. The exclusion of such evidence, however, would have been
            meaningless if jurors were already familiar with the same facts from previous television
            or newspaper reports. Wade might have influenced prospective jurors by his mistaken
            statement that
            
            		Page 239
            		
            		
            		the paraffin test showed that Oswald had fired a gun. The tests merely showed that he had nitrate traces on his hands,
            which did not necessarily mean that he had fired either a rifle or a pistol.
            		
            		
            		The disclosure of evidence was seriously aggravated by the statements of numerous
            responsible officials that they were certain of Oswald's guilt. Captain Fritz said that the case against Oswald was "cinched." Curry reported on Saturday that "we are sure of our case." 253 Curry
            announced that he considered Oswald sane, and Wade told the public that he would ask for the death penalty.
            		
            		
            		The American Bar Association declared in December 1963 that "widespread publicizing of Oswald's alleged guilt, involving statements by officials and public disclosures of the details
            of 'evidence,' would have made it extremely difficult to impanel an unprejudiced jury
            and afford the accused a fair trial." 255 Local bar associations expressed similar
            feelings. The Commission agrees that Lee Harvey Oswald's opportunity for a trial by 12 jurors free of preconception as to his guilt or innocence
            would have been seriously jeopardized by the premature disclosure and weighing of
            the evidence against him.
            		
            		
            		The problem of disclosure of information and its effect on trials is, of course,
            further complicated by the independent activities of the press in developing information
            on its own from sources other than law enforcement agencies. Had the police not released
            the specific items of evidence against Oswald, it is still possible that the other information presented on television and in the
            newspapers, chiefly of a biographical nature, would itself have had a prejudicial
            effect on the public.
            		
            		
            		In explanation of the news policy adopted by the Dallas authorities, Chief Curry
            observed that "it seemed like there was a great demand by the general public to know
            what was going on." 257 In a prepared statement, Captain King wrote:
            		
            		At that time we felt a necessity for permitting the newsmen as much latitude as
            possible. We realized the magnitude of the incident the newsmen were there to cover.
            We realized that not only the nation but the world would be greatly interested in
            what occurred in Dallas. We believed that we had an obligation to make as widely known
            as possible everything we could regarding the investigation of the assassination and
            the manner in which we undertook that investigation.
            		
            		The Commission recognizes that the people of the United States, and indeed the world,
            had a deep-felt interest in learning of the events surrounding the death of President Kennedy, including the development of the investigation in Dallas. An informed public provided
            the ultimate guarantee that adequate steps would be taken to apprehend those responsible
            for the assassination and that all necessary precautions would be taken to protect
            the national security. It was therefore proper and desirable that the public know
            which agencies
            
            		Page 240
            		
            		
            		were participating in the investigation and the rate at which their work was progressing.
            The public was also entitled to know that Lee Harvey Oswald had been apprehended and that the State had gathered sufficient evidence to arraign
            him for the murders of the President and Patrolman Tippit, that he was being held
            pending action of the grand jury, that the investigation was continuing, and that
            the law enforcement agencies had discovered no evidence which tended to show that
            any other person was involved in either slaying.
            		
            		
            		However, neither the press nor the public had a right to be contemporaneously informed
            by the police or prosecuting authorities of the details of the evidence being accumulated
            against Oswald. Undoubtedly the public was interested in these disclosures, but its curiosity should
            not have been satisfied at the expense of the accused's right to a trial by an impartial
            jury. The courtroom, not the newspaper or television screen, is the appropriate forum
            in our system for the trial of a man accused of a crime.
            		
            		
            		If the evidence in the possession of the authorities had not been disclosed, it
            is true that the public would not have been in a position to assess the adequacy of
            the investigation or to apply pressures for further official undertakings. But a major
            consequence of the hasty and at times inaccurate divulgence of evidence after the
            assassination was simply to give rise to groundless rumors and public confusion. Moreover,
            without learning the details of the case, the public could have been informed by the
            responsible authority of the general scope of the investigation and the extent to
            which State and Federal agencies were assisting in the police work.
            		
            		
            		RESPONSIBILITY OF NEWS MEDIA
            		
            		
            		While appreciating the heavy and unique pressures with which the Dallas Police Department
            was confronted by reason of the assassination of President Kennedy, primary responsibility for having failed to control the press and to check the flow
            of undigested evidence to the public must be borne by the police department. It was
            the only agency that could have established orderly and sound operating procedures
            to control the multitude of newsmen gathered in the police building after the assassination.
            		
            		
            		The Commission believes, however, that a part of the responsibility for the unfortunate
            circumstances following the President's death must be borne by the news media. The
            crowd of newsmen generally failed to respond properly to the demands of the police.
            Frequently without permission, news representatives used police offices on the third
            floor, tying up facilities and interfering with normal police operations. Police efforts
            to preserve order and to clear passageways in the corridor were usually unsuccessful.
            On Friday night the reporters completely ignored Curry's injunction against asking
            Oswald questions in the assembly room and crowding in on him. On Sunday morning, the newsmen
            were instructed to direct no questions
            
            		Page 241
            		
            		
            		at Oswald; nevertheless, several reporters shouted questions at him when he appeared in the
            basement.
            		
            		
            		Moreover, by constantly pursuing public officials, the news representatives placed
            an insistent pressure upon them to disclose information. And this pressure was not
            without effect, since the police attitude toward the press was affected by the desire
            to maintain satisfactory relations with the news representatives and to create a favorable
            image of themselves. Chief Curry frankly told the Commission that
            		
            		I didn't order them out of the building, which if I had it to do over I would. In
            the past like I say, we had always maintained very good relations with our press,
            and they had always respected us... 260
            		
            		Curry refused Fritz' request to put Oswald behind the screen in the assembly room at the Friday night press conference because
            this might have hindered the taking of pictures. Curry's subordinates had the impression
            that an unannounced transfer of Oswald to the county jail was unacceptable because Curry did not want to disappoint the
            newsmen; he had promised that they could witness the transfer. It seemed clear enough
            that any attempt to exclude the press from the building or to place limits on the
            information disclosed to them would have been resented and disputed by the newsmen,
            who were constantly and aggressively demanding all possible information about anything
            related to the assassination.
            		
            		
            		Although the Commission has found no corroboration in the video and audio tapes,
            police officials recall that one or two representatives of the press reinforced their
            demands to see Oswald by suggesting that the police had been guilty of brutalizing him. They intimated
            that unless they were given the opportunity to see him, these suggestions would be
            passed on to the public. Captain King testified that he had been told that
            		
            		A short time after Oswald's arrest one newsman held up a photograph and said, "This is what the man charged with
            the assassination of the President looks like. Or at least this is what he did look
            like. We don't know what he looks like after an hour in the custody of the Dallas
            Police Department." 264
            		
            		City Manager Elgin Crull stated that when he visited Chief Curry in his office on
            the morning of November 23, Curry told him that he "felt it was necessary to cooperate with the news media representatives,
            in order to avoid being accused of using Gestapo tactics in connection with the handling
            of Oswald." Crull agreed with Curry. The Commission deems any such veiled threats to be absolutely
            without justification.
            		
            		
            		The general disorder in the Police and Courts Building during November 22-24 reveals a regrettable lack of self-discipline by the newsmen.
            
            		Page 242
            		
            		
            		The Commission believes that the news media, as well as the police authorities,
            who failed to impose conditions more in keeping with the orderly process of justice,
            must share responsibility for the failure of law enforcement which occurred in connection
            with the death of Oswald. On previous occasions, public bodies have voiced the need for the exercise of self-restraint
            by the news media in periods when the demand for information must be tempered by other
            fundamental requirements of our society.
            		
            		
            			At its annual meeting in Washington in April 1964, the American Society of Newspaper Editors discussed the role of the press in Dallas
            immediately after President Kennedy's assassination. The discussion revealed the strong misgivings among the editors
            themselves about the role that the press had played and their desire that the press
            display more self-discipline and adhere to higher standards of conduct in the future.
            To prevent a recurrence of the unfortunate events which followed the assassination,
            however, more than general concern will be needed. The promulgation of a code of professional
            conduct governing representatives of all news media would be welcome evidence that
            the press had profiled by the lesson of Dallas.
            		
            		
            		The burden of insuring that appropriate action is taken to establish ethical standards
            of conduct for the news media must also be borne, however, by State and local governments,
            by the bar, and ultimately by the public. The experience in Dallas during November 22-24 is a dramatic affirmation of the need for steps to bring about a proper balance between
            the right of the public to be kept informed and the right of the individual to a fair
            and impartial trial.

            Conclusion
            
            
            
            THE EVIDENCE reviewed above identifies Lee Harvey Oswald as the assassin of President
            Kennedy and indicates that he acted alone in that event. There is no evidence that
            he had accomplices or that he was involved in any conspiracy directed to the assassination
            of the President. There remains the question of what impelled Oswald to conceive and
            to carry out the assassination of the President of the United States. The Commission
            has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which
            might flow from Oswald's commitment to Marxism or communism, the existence of some
            personal grievance, a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or simply
            to go down in history as a well publicized assassin. None of these possibilities satisfactorily
            explains Oswald's act if it is judged by the standards of reasonable men. The motives
            of any man, however, must be analyzed in terms of the character and state of mind
            of the particular individual involved. For a motive that appears incomprehensible
            to other men may be the moving force of a man whose view of the world has been twisted,
            possibly by factors of which those around him were only dimly aware. Oswald's complete
            state of mind and character are now outside of the power of man to know. He cannot,
            of course, be questioned or observed by those charged with the responsibility for
            this report or by experts on their behalf. There is, however, a large amount of material
            available in his writings and in the history of his life which does give some insight
            into his character and, possibly, into the motives for his act.
            
            
            Commission
            Since Oswald is dead, the Commission is not able to reach any definite conclusions
            as to whether or not he was "sane" under prevailing legal standards. Under our system
            of justice no forum could properly make that determination unless Oswald were before
            it. It certainly could not be made by this Commission which, as has been pointed out
            above, ascertained the facts surrounding the assassination but did not draw conclusions
            concerning Oswald's legal guilt.
            
            
            Commission
            Indications of Oswald's motivation may be obtained from a study of the events, relationships
            and influences which appear to have been.
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Marina Oswald
            
            
            
            
            significant in shaping his character and in guiding him. Perhaps the most outstanding
            conclusion of such a study is that Oswald was profoundly alienated from the world
            in which he lived. His life was characterized by isolation, frustration, and failure.
            He had very few, if any, close relationships with other people and he appeared to
            have great difficulty in finding a meaningful place in the world. He was never satisfied
            with anything. When he was in the United States he resented the capitalist system
            which he thought was exploiting him and others like him. He seemed to prefer the Soviet
            Union and he spoke highly of Cuba. When he was in the Soviet Union, he apparently
            resented the Communist Party members, who were accorded special privileges and who
            he thought were betraying communism, and he spoke well of the United States. He accused
            his wife of preferring others to himself and told her to return to the Soviet Union
            without him but without a divorce. At the same time he professed his love for her
            and said that he could not get along without her. Marina Oswald thought that he would
            not be happy anywhere, "Only on the moon, perhaps."
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            Only on the moon, perhaps.
            
            
            While Oswald appeared to most of those who knew him as a meek and harmless person,
            he sometimes imagined himself as "the Commander" and, apparently seriously, as a political
            prophet--a man who said that after 20 years he would be prime minister. His wife testified
            that he compared himself with great readers of history. Such ideas of grandeur were
            apparently accompanied by notions of oppression. He had a great hostility toward his
            environment, whatever it happened to be, which he expressed in striking and sometimes
            violent acts long before the assassination. There was some quality about him that
            led him to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences. He defected to
            the Soviet Union, shot at General Walker, tried to go to Cuba and even contemplated
            hijacking an airplane to get there. He assassinated the President, shot Officer Tippit,
            resisted arrest and tried to kill another policeman in the process.
            
            
            Oswald apparently started reading about communism when he was about 15. In the Marines,
            he evidenced a strong conviction as to the correctness of Marxist doctrine, which
            one associate described as "irrevocable," but also as "theoretical"; that associate
            did not think that Oswald was a Communist. Oswald did not always distinguish between
            Marxism and communism. He stated several times that he was a Communist but apparently
            never joined any Communist Party.
            
            
            His attachment to Marxist and Communist doctrine was probably, in some measure, an
            expression of his hostility to his environment. While there is doubt about how fully
            Oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused, it seems clear that his
            commitment to Marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult
            years. It was an obvious element in his decision to go to Russia and later to Cuba
            and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at General Walker. It was a factor
            which contributed to his character.

            Marguerite Oswald

            John Pic
            Edwin A. Ekdahl
            
            
            
            
            and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate President Kennedy.
            
            
            The discussion below will describe the events known to the Commission which most clearly
            reveals the formation and nature of Oswald's character. It will attempt to summarize
            the events of his early life, his experience in New York City and in the Marine Corps,
            and his interest in Marxism. It will examine his defection to the Soviet Union in
            1959, his subsequent return to the United States and his life here after June of 1962. The review of the latter period will evaluate his personal and employment relations,
            his attempt to kill General Walker, his political activities, and his unsuccessful
            attempt to go to Cuba in late September of 1963. Various possible motives will be treated in the appropriate context of the discussion
            outlined above.
            
            
            
            Significant in shaping the character of Lee Harvey Oswald was the death of his father,
            a collector of insurance premiums. This occurred 2 months before Lee was born in New
            Orleans on October 18, 1939. That death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the Oswald family.
            It had its effect on Lee's mother, Marguerite, his brother Robert, who had been born
            in 1934, and his half-brother John Pic, who had been born in 1932 during Marguerite's
            previous marriage. It forced Marguerite Oswald to go to work to provide for her family.
            Reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the family's financial condition
            was poor, she placed John Pic and Robert Oswald in an orphans' home. From the time
            Marguerite Oswald returned to work until December 26, 1942, when Lee too was sent to the orphans' home, he was cared for principally by his
            mother's sister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.
            
            
            Marguerite Oswald withdrew Lee from the orphans' home and took him with her to Dallas
            when he was a little over 4 years old. About 6 months later she also withdrew John
            Pic and Robert Oswald. Apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage
            to Edwin A. Ekdahl, which took place in May of 1945. In the fall of that year John Pic and Robert Oswald went to a military academy where
            they stayed, except for vacations, until the spring of 1948. Lee Oswald remained with
            his mother and Ekdahl, to whom he became quite attached. John Pic testified that he
            thought Lee found in Ekdahl the father that he never had. That situation, however,
            was short-lived, for the relations between Marguerite Oswald and Ekdahl were stormy
            and they were finally divorced, after several separations and reunions, in the summer
            of 1948.
            
            
            After the divorce Mrs. Oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated,
            dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children. John Pic, however,
            did not think her position was worse than that of many other people. In the fall of
            1948 she told John Pic and Robert Oswald that she could not afford to send them back
            to the military school and she asked Pic to quit school.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Marguerite Oswald
            Pic
            Robert
            John Pic
            Mrs. Lillian Murret
            
            
            
            
            entirely to help support the family, which he did for 4 months in the fall of 1948.
            In order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that Pic was 17 years
            old so that he could join the Marine Corps Reserves. Pic did turn over part of his
            income to his mother, but he returned to high school in January of 1949, where he stayed until 3 days before he was scheduled to graduate, when he left school
            in order to get into the Coast Guard. Since his mother did not approve of his decision
            to continue school he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed
            his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards.
            
            
            Pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned
            about money. Referring to the period after the divorce from Ekdahl, which was apparently
            caused in part by Marguerite's desire to get more money from him, Pic said: "Lee was
            brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems, and I am sure it had quite
            an effect on him, and also Robert." Marguerite Oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs
            after her divorce from Ekdahl. When she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady,
            she would sometimes take Lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while
            she transacted her business. When she worked during the school year, Lee had to leave
            an empty house in the morning, return to it for lunch and then again at night, his
            mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children.
            
            
            An indication of the nature of Lee's character at this time was provided in the spring
            of 1950, when he was sent to New Orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister,
            Mrs. Lillian Murret, for 2 or 3 weeks. Despite their urgings, he refused to play with
            the other children his own age. It also appears that Lee tried to tag along with his
            older brothers but apparently was not able to spend as much time with them as he would
            have liked, because of the age gaps of 5 and 7 years, which became more significant
            as the children grew older.
            
            
            Whatever problems may have been created by Lee's home life in Louisiana and Texas,
            he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an average, although gradually
            deteriorating, school record with no behavior or truancy problems. That was not the
            case, however, after he and his mother moved to New York in August of 1952, shortly before Lee's 13th birthday. They moved shortly after Robert joined the Marines;
            they lived for a time with John Pic who was stationed there with the Coast Guard.
            Relations soon became strained, however, so in late September Lee and his mother moved
            to their own apartment in the Bronx. Pic and his wife would have been happy to have
            kept Lee, however, who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having
            struck her on at least one occasion.
            
            
            The short-lived stay with the Pics was terminated after an incident in which Lee allegedly
            pulled out a pocket knife during an argument.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Marguerite Oswald
            John Carro
            Dr. Renatus Hartogs
            Mrs. Evelyn D Siegel
            Mrs. Pic
            
            
            
            
            and threatened to use it on Mrs. Pic. When Pic returned home, Mrs. Oswald tried to
            play down the event but Mrs. Pic took a different view and asked the Oswalds to leave.
            Lee refused to discuss the matter with Pic, whom he had previously idolized, and their
            relations were strained thereafter.
            
            
            On September 30, 1952, Lee enrolled in P.S. 117, a junior high school in the Bronx, where the other children
            apparently teased him because of his "western" clothes and Texas accent. He began
            to stay away from school, preferring to read magazines and watch television at home
            by himself. This continued despite the efforts of the school authorities and, to a
            lesser extent, of his mother to have him return to school. Truancy charges were brought
            against him alleging that he was "beyond the control of his mother insofar as school
            attendance is concerned." Oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to Youth
            House, an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation or for
            detention pending court appearance or commitment to a child-caring or custodial institution
            such as a training school.
            
            
            He was in Youth House from April 16 to May 7, 1953, during which time he was examined by its Chief Psychiatrist, Dr. Renatus Hartogs,
            and interviewed and observed by other members of the Youth House staff.
            
            
            Marguerite Oswald visited her son at Youth House, where she recalled that she waited
            in line "with Puerto Ricans and Negroes and everything." She said that her pocketbook
            was searched "because the children in this home were such criminals, dope fiends,
            and had been in criminal offenses, that anybody entering this home had to be searched
            in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or anything." She recalled
            that Lee cried and said, "Mother, I want to get out of here. There are children in
            here who have killed people, and smoke. I want to get out." Marguerite Oswald said
            that she had not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been confined.
            
            
            On the other hand, Lee told his probation officer, John Carro, that "while he liked
            Youth House he miss[ed] the freedom of doing what he wanted. He indicated that he
            did not miss his mother." Mrs. Evelyn D Siegel, a social worker who interviewed both
            Lee and his mother while Lee was confined in Youth House, reported that Lee "confided
            that the worse thing about Youth House was the fact that he had to be with other boys
            all the time, was disturbed about disrobing in front of them, taking showers with
            them etc."
            
            
            Contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination, the psychiatric examination
            did not indicate that Lee Oswald was a potential assassin, potentially dangerous,
            that "his outlook on life had strongly paranoid overtones" or that he should be institutionalized.
            Dr. Hartogs did find Oswald to be a tense, withdrawn, and evasive boy who intensely
            disliked talking about himself and his feelings. He noted that Lee liked to give the
            impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself,
            so that he was not bothered and did not have to make the effort of communicating.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald

            Mrs. Siegel
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I don't want a friend and I don't like to talk to people.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I dislike everybody.
            
            
            Dr. Hartogs
            This 13 year old well built boy has superior mental resources and functions only slightly
            below his capacity level in spite of chronic truancy from school.
            
            
            Mrs. Siegel
            He always felt like a burden that she simply just had to tolerate.
            
            
            
            Wald's withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be the result of "intense
            anxiety, shyness, feelings of awkwardness and insecurity." He was reported to have
            said he was also described as having a "Vivid fantasy life, turning around the topics
            of omnipotence and power, through which he tries to compensate for his present shortcomings
            and frustrations." Dr. Hartogs summarized his report by stating: Lee has to be diagnosed
            as "personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive--aggressive
            tendencies." Lee has to be seen as an emotionally, quite disturbed youngster who suffers
            under the impact of really existing emotional isolation and deprivation, lack of affection,
            absence of family life and rejection by a self involved and conflicted mother. Dr.
            Hartogs recommended that Oswald be placed on probation on condition that he seek help
            and guidance through a child guidance clinic. There, he suggested, Lee should be treated
            by a male psychiatrist who could substitute for the lack of a father figure. He also
            recommended that Mrs. Oswald seek "psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with
            a family agency." The possibility of commitment was to be considered only if the probation
            plan was not successful. Lee's withdrawal was also noted by Mrs. Siegel, who described
            him as a "seriously detached, withdrawn youngster." She also noted that there was
            "a rather pleasant, appealing quality about this emotionally starved, affectionless
            youngster which grows as one speaks to him." She thought that he had detached himself
            from the world around him because "no one in it ever met any of his needs for love."
            She observed that since Lee's mother worked all day, he made his own meals and spent
            all his time alone because he didn't make friends with the boys in the neighborhood.
            She thought that he "withdrew into a completely solitary and detached existence where
            he did as he wanted and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with
            people." Mrs. Siegel concluded that Lee "just felt that his mother never gave a damn
            for him." Lee confirmed some of those observations by saying that he felt almost as
            if there were a veil between him and other people through which they could not reach
            him, but that he preferred the veil to remain intact. He admitted to fantasies about
            being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people, but refused to elaborate
            on them. He took the position that such matters were his own business.

            Lee was disruptive in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in the
            fall of 1953.
            
            
            Mrs. Siegel
            Mrs. Oswald was a smartly dressed, gray haired woman, very self-possessed and alert
            and superficially affable, but essentially a defensive, rigid, self-involved person.
            
            
            
            A psychological human figure-drawing test corroborated the interviewer's findings
            that Lee was insecure and had limited social contacts. Irving Sokolow, a Youth House
            psychologist, reported that the drawings reflected a considerable amount of impoverishment
            in the social and emotional areas. He appears to be a somewhat insecure youngster
            exhibiting much inclination for warm and satisfying relationships to others. There
            is some indication that he may relate to men more easily than to women in view of
            the more mature conceptualization. He appears slightly withdrawn and in view of the
            lack of detail within the drawings, this may assume a more significant characteristic.
            He exhibits some difficulty in relationship to the maternal figure suggesting more
            anxiety in this area than in any other. Lee scored an IQ of 118 on the Wechsler Intelligence
            Scale for Children. According to Sokolow, this indicated a "present intellectual functioning
            in the upper range of bright normal intelligence." Sokolow said that although Lee
            was "presumably disinterested in school subjects he operates on a much higher than
            average level." On the Monroe Silent Reading Test, Lee's score indicated no retardation
            in reading speed and comprehension; he had better than average ability in arithmetical
            reasoning for his age group. Lee told Carro, his probation officer, that he liked
            to be by himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends. The reports
            of Carro and Mrs. Siegel also indicate an ambivalent attitude toward authority on
            Oswald's part. Carro reported that Lee was disruptive in class after he returned to
            school on a regular basis in the fall of 1953. He had refused to salute the flag and
            was doing very little, if any, work. It appears that he did not want to do any of
            the things which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring him out of the
            shell into which he appeared to be retreating. He told Mrs. Siegel that he would run
            away if sent to a boarding school. On the other hand, he also told her that he wished
            his mother had been more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to school.
            The reports of the New York authorities indicate that Lee's mother gave him very little
            affection and did not serve as any sort of substitute for a father. Furthermore, she
            did not appear to understand her own relationship to Lee's psychological problems.
            After her interview with Mrs. Oswald, Mrs. Siegel described her as a smartly dressed,
            gray haired woman, very self-possessed and alert and superficially affable, but essentially
            a defensive, rigid, self-involved person who had real difficulty in accepting and
            relating to people and who had little understanding of Lee's behavior and of the protective
            shell he has drawn around himself. Dr. Hartogs reported that Mrs. Oswald did not understand
            that Lee's withdrawal was a form of violent but silent protest against his neglect
            by her and represents his reac-

            Lee Oswald
            Well, I've got to live with her. I guess I love her.
            
            
            John Pic
            Lee slept with my mother until I joined the service in 1950. This would make him approximately
            10, well, almost 11 years old.
            
            
            Carro
            There was nothing that would lead me to believe when I saw him at the age of 12 that
            there would be seeds of destruction for somebody.
            
            
            Mrs. Siegel
            Despite his withdrawal, he gives the impression that he is not so difficult to reach
            as he appears.
            
            
            
            The factors in Lee Oswald's personality which were noted by those who had contact
            with him in New York indicate that he had great difficulty in adapting himself to
            conditions in that city. His usual reaction to the problems which he encountered there
            was simply withdrawal. Those factors indicated a severe inability to enter into relationships
            with other people. In view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in New
            Orleans in the spring of 1950, and his other solitary habits, Lee had apparently been
            experiencing similar problems before going to New York, and as will be shown below,
            this failure to adapt to his environment was a dominant trait in his later life.
            
            It would be incorrect, however, to believe that those aspects of Lee's personality
            which were observed in New York could have led anyone to predict the outburst of violence
            which finally occurred. Carro was the only one of Oswald's three principal observers
            who recommended that he be placed in a boy's home or similar institution. But Carro
            was quite specific that his recommendation was based primarily on the adverse factors
            in Lee's environment—his lack of friends, the apparent unavailability of any agency
            assistance, and the ineffectualness of his mother—and not on any particular mental
            disturbance in the boy himself. Carro testified that there was nothing that would
            lead him to believe when he saw him at the age of 12 that there would be seeds of
            destruction for somebody. 
            
            Mrs. Siegel concluded her report with the statement that despite his withdrawal, he
            gives the impression that he is not so difficult to reach as he appears and patient,
            prolonged effort in a sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results.
            There are indications that he has suffered serious personality damage but if he can
            receive help quickly this might be repaired to some extent. 
            
            Lee Oswald never received that help. Few social agencies even in New York were equipped
            to provide the kind of intensive treatment that he needed, and when one of the city's
            clinics did find room to handle him, for some reason the record does not show, advantage
            was never taken of the chance afforded to Oswald. When Lee became a disciplinary problem
            upon his return to school in the fall of 1953, and when his mother failed to cooperate
            in any way with school authorities, authorities were finally forced to consider placement
            in a home for boys. Such a placement was postponed, however, perhaps in part at...

            Edward Voebel
            He was more bashful about girls than anything else.
            
            
            Edward Voebel
            He wouldn't start any fights, but if you wanted to start one with him, he was going
            to make sure that he ended it.
            
            
            
            After his return to New Orleans Oswald was teased at school because of the northern
            accent which he had acquired. He concluded that school had nothing to offer him. His
            mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether
            to go on in school. Neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall an introverted
            boy who read a great deal. He took walks and visited museums, and sometimes rode a
            rented bicycle in the park on Saturday mornings. Mrs. Murret believes that he talked
            at length with a girl on the telephone, but no one remembers that he had any dates.
            
            
            Several witnesses testified that Lee Oswald was not aggressive. He was, however, involved
            in some fights. Once a group of white boys beat him up for sitting in the Negro section
            of a bus, which he apparently did simply out of ignorance. Another time, he fought
            with two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of them, 3 years Oswald's
            junior. Two days later, "some big guy, probably from a high school--he looked like
            a tremendous football player" accosted Oswald on the way home from school and punched
            him in the mouth, making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth. Voebel took Oswald back
            to the school to attend to his wounds, and their "mild friendship" stemmed from that
            incident. 
            
            Voebel also recalled that Oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window
            of a store on Rampart Street and steal a pistol, but he was not sure then that Oswald
            meant to carry out the plan, and in fact they never did. In a space for the names
            of "close friends" on the ninth grade personal history record, Oswald first wrote
            "Edward Vogel," an obvious misspelling of Voebel's name, and "Arthor Abear," most
            likely Arthur Hebert, a classmate who has said that he did not know Oswald well. Oswald
            erased those names, however, and indicated that he had no close friends.
            
            It has been suggested that this misspelling of names, apparently on a phonetic basis,
            was caused by a reading-spelling disability from which Oswald appeared to suffer.
            Other evidence of the existence of such a disability is provided by the many other
            misspellings that appear in Oswald's writings, portions of which are quoted below.

            William E. Wulf
            He started expounding the Communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested
            in communism, that communism was the only way of life for the worker.
            
            
            Marguerite Oswald
            Lee lived for the time that he would become 17 years old to join the Marines--that
            whole year.
            
            
            John Pic
            To get from out and under ... the yoke of oppression from my mother.
            
            
            
            Oswald started to read Communist literature, which he obtained from the public library.
            One of his fellow employees, Palmer McBride, stated that Oswald said he would like
            to kill President Eisenhower because he was exploiting the working class. Oswald praised
            Khrushchev and suggested that he and McBride join the Communist Party "to take advantage
            of their social functions." 
            
            Oswald also became interested in the New Orleans Amateur Astronomy Association, an
            organization of high school students. The association's then president, William E.
            Wulf, testified that he remembered an occasion when Oswald ... started expounding
            the Communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested in communism, that
            communism was the only way of life for the worker, et cetera, and then came out with
            a statement that he was looking for a Communist cell in town to join but he couldn't
            find any. 
            
            Despite this apparent interest in communism, Oswald tried to join the Marines when
            he was 16 years old. This was 1 year before his actual enlistment and just a little
            over 2.5 years after he left New York. He wrote a note in his mother's name to school
            authorities in New Orleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his mother
            were moving to San Diego. In fact, he had quit school in an attempt to obtain his
            mother's assistance to join the Marines. 
            
            While he apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false statement about
            his age he was nevertheless unable to convince the proper authorities that he was
            really 17 years old. There is evidence that Oswald was greatly influenced in his decision
            to join the Marines by the fact that his brother Robert had done so approximately
            3 years before. Robert Oswald had given his Marine Corps manual to his brother Lee,
            who studied it during the year following his unsuccessful attempt to enlist until
            "He knew it by heart." 
            
            According to Marguerite Oswald, "Lee lived for the time that he would become 17 years
            old to join the Marines--that whole year." In John Pic's view, Oswald was motivated
            to join the Marines in large part by a desire "to get from out and under ... the yoke
            of oppression from my mother."
            
            Oswald's inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful relationships with other
            people continued during this period in New Orleans (1954-56). It probably contributed
            greatly to the general dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment, a
            dissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular point in his life.

            Definitely the Marine Corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined.
            
            
            Daniel Powers
            Always [to be] striving for a relationship, but whenever he did ... his general personality
            would alienate the group against him.
            
            
            John E. Donovan
            Authority, particularly the Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such
            as his own, without a given magic college degree, and put them in positions of prominence.
            
            
            Kerry Thornley
            Oswald's extreme personal sloppiness in the Marine Corps fitted into a general personality
            pattern of his: to do whatever was not wanted of him.
            
            
            
            Oswald's intense desire to join the Marines and get away from his surroundings and
            his mother continued throughout his time in the Marine Corps. His study of Communist
            literature, which might appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the Marines,
            could have been another manifestation of Oswald's rejection of his environment.
            
            His difficulty in relating to other people and his general dissatisfaction with the
            world around him persisted while he was in the Marine Corps. Kerry Thornley, a marine
            associate, testified that "definitely the Marine Corps was not what he had expected
            it to be when he joined." He observed that Oswald "seemed to guard against developing
            real close friendships." 
            
            Daniel Powers, another marine who was stationed with Oswald for part of his career,
            noted that Oswald seemed "always striving for a relationship, but whenever he did
            ... his general personality would alienate the group against him." Other marines also
            confirmed that Oswald had few friends and kept to himself.
            
            While there is nothing in Oswald's military records to indicate mental instability,
            he did not adjust well to the conditions in the service. He did not rise above the
            rank of private first class, despite passing a qualifying examination for corporal.
            His military career was hampered by his belief in his own great ability and intelligence,
            thinking that many of his superiors were not competent enough to give him orders.
            
            John E. Donovan, one of his former officers, testified that Oswald believed "that
            authority, particularly the Marine Corps, ought to be able to recognize talent such
            as his own." Oswald often baited his officers into discussions about foreign affairs,
            which he had studied extensively, thus regarding them as unfit to command when they
            struggled to keep up.
            
            Nelson Delgado, a fellow Marine, testified that Oswald would "cut up anybody that
            was high ranking" during these arguments to assert his dominance. His arguments with
            superiors likely stemmed from a desire to attract attention to himself and to bolster
            his inflated sense of self-worth.
            
            Thornley also observed that Oswald's extreme personal sloppiness in the Marine Corps
            was consistent with a general personality trend of doing what was not wanted of him.
            He "seemed to be a person who would go out of his way to get into trouble" and then
            used the "special treatment" he received as a justification for his behavior.

            He was meek and easily led, an individual that you would brainwash.
            
            
            Daniel Powers
            All the Marine Corps did was to teach you to kill and after you got out of the Marines
            you might be good gangsters.

            Oswald's behavior during his time in the Marine Corps suggested a complex personality.
            Kerry Thornley observed that Oswald seemed to maintain a persecution complex, feeling
            that he was being picked on and watched closely due to his supposed subversive activities.
            Thornley noted that while he wouldn't label Oswald as paranoid, there was a definite
            tendency in that direction.
            
            Daniel Powers described Oswald as meek and easily led, suggesting he could be brainwashed
            but would stand firm in his beliefs once he embraced them. Powers characterized Oswald
            as reserved and somewhat frail, giving him the nickname "Ozzie Rabbit." He noted that
            Oswald read extensively, preferring literature like "Leaves of Grass" by Walt Whitman
            over typical adventure stories. 
            
            Powers recounted that Oswald expressed disillusionment with the Marine Corps, claiming
            it only trained people to kill and that ex-Marines might end up as gangsters. Upon
            arriving in Japan, Oswald appeared to gain confidence and adopt a more aggressive
            demeanor, possibly due to developing a romantic relationship, transforming from "Oswald
            the rabbit" to "Oswald the man."
            
            However, this newfound self-assurance led to an incident where Oswald spilled a drink
            on a sergeant and challenged him to a fight, a confrontation that arose while he was
            intoxicated. At his court-martial, Oswald argued that he had simply wanted to discuss
            matters with the sergeant, although he was found guilty of provoking words.
            
            Later, Oswald requested a transfer from active duty to the Marine Corps Reserve to
            care for his mother after her work-related injury. Ultimately, he received an undesirable
            discharge from the Marine Corps Reserve, which followed a period of inactivity after
            his transfer.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Marina Oswald
            Governor Connally
            
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            Lee said that when he would return to the United States he would vote for him [for
            Governor].
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            He never had anything against [Kennedy].
            
            
            
            Following his defection to the Soviet Union, Oswald sought to reverse his undesirable
            discharge from the Marine Corps. He wrote to Secretary of the Navy Connally, expressing
            his intent to rectify what he perceived as a gross mistake. Although Connally had
            just resigned to run for Governor of Texas and forwarded Oswald's letter to his successor,
            it was evident that Oswald understood that Connally was not directly responsible for
            his discharge, nor did he hold any grievances against President Kennedy or Connally.
            
            Marina Oswald testified that her husband spoke well of Kennedy during their time in
            Russia and did not express any ill will towards him. Despite this, Oswald felt unjustly
            treated by the military and pursued efforts to have his discharge reconsidered. His
            dissatisfaction stemmed from the fact that his discharge was unrelated to his conduct
            while on active duty and that he was unaware of the original discharge proceedings
            due to his absence.
            
            The Commission considered whether Connally could have been Oswald's actual target
            during the assassination attempt. Marina suggested that her husband might have intended
            to shoot Connally rather than Kennedy, linking this belief to Oswald's concerns about
            his discharge. However, the circumstances during the assassination made it almost
            impossible for Oswald to shoot Connally without hitting Kennedy first, given their
            positions in the limousine. Oswald would have had more advantageous opportunities
            to target Connally at different points along the route.

            Lee Oswald
            I'm a Marxist, ... I became interested about the age of 15.
            
            
            Kerry Thornley
            I think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of years ... and I don't
            think you could have changed his mind on that.
            
            
            
            Following his departure from New York to New Orleans, Lee Oswald began reading Communist
            literature, stating his ideological leanings when he told reporter Aline Mosby, "I'm
            a Marxist." He became interested around the age of 15 after being handed a pamphlet
            about saving the Rosenbergs. Oswald's study of Marxism continued during his time in
            the Marines, where his sympathies towards Marxism and the Soviet Union became well-known
            among his peers, earning him nicknames such as "comrade" and "Oswaldskovitch."
            
            His fascination with the Soviet Union was reflected in his preference to play the
            red pieces in chess, humorously noting he preferred the "Red Army." Oswald actively
            studied the Russian language and read Russian-language newspapers, demonstrating a
            keen interest in Soviet affairs.
            
            Kerry Thornley, a fellow Marine, noted that Oswald's belief in Marxism was deeply
            ingrained, suggesting that no amount of formal debate would sway him from his convictions.
            Thornley recounted a moment that illustrated Oswald's Marxist sympathies intertwined
            with his enjoyment of George Orwell's "1984." During a lackluster parade event, Oswald
            appeared lost in thought, yet the influence of his beliefs remained evident in their
            conversations.

            Kerry Thornley
            Well, comes the revolution you will change all that.
            
            
            Lieutenant Donovan
            There were many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international situation.
            
            
            Kerry Thornley
            He looked upon the eyes of future people as some kind of tribunal, and he wanted to
            be on the winning side...
            
            
            
            During a discussion about the parade, Oswald expressed his anger and disdain, prompting
            Thornley to quip, "Well, comes the revolution you will change all that." Oswald reacted
            intensely, looking at Thornley as if betrayed and exclaiming, "Not you, too, Thornley,"
            indicating that he was disturbed by the remark, which Thornley later clarified was
            not meant to criticize Oswald's political beliefs.
            
            Lieutenant Donovan noted Oswald's belief in the existence of significant injustices
            in global affairs, particularly his interest in Latin America and opposition to the
            Batista regime in Cuba, alongside a sympathy for Castro. However, Donovan stated that
            he never heard Oswald express a desire to personally eliminate these injustices or
            openly identify as a Communist. Nelson Delgado remarked that Oswald was a believer
            in the need for change in the American government, yet he did not advocate for a Communist
            system.
            
            Thornley reflected on Oswald's perception of history, suggesting that he wished to
            be remembered favorably in the future, as if judged by a tribunal of future generations.
            This desire for a historical legacy, combined with his present-day discontent, may
            have influenced Oswald's drastic actions, including his defection, which garnered
            significant media attention and brought his name into public discourse.

            Kerry Thornley
            I think he wanted both if he could have them. If he didn't, he wanted to die with
            the knowledge that, or with the idea that he was somebody.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            ...the conclusive thing that made him decide that Marxism was the answer was his service
            in Japan.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            ...he said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the
            system, and that possibly Marxism was the answer.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            ...he wrote to his brother Robert that the Soviet Union...
            
            
            
            Oswald's complex motivations for his actions suggest a dual desire for both recognition
            and a legacy. His interest in Marxism both alienated and attracted individuals around
            him; while some avoided him, others believed his interest was a means to gain attention.
            This pattern was evident in his employment struggles upon returning from the Soviet
            Union. Oswald often cited Marxism as a justification for his social difficulties,
            which likely stemmed from other underlying issues. His commitment to Marxism influenced
            significant life choices, such as his defection to the Soviet Union in 1959 and his
            involvement with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in 1963.
            
            Following his discharge from the Marine Corps in September 1959, ostensibly to care for his mother, Oswald quickly traveled to the Soviet Union to
            renounce his U.S. citizenship. This act marked a pivotal moment in his life, showcasing
            his readiness to act on his beliefs in drastic ways.
            
            Although Oswald's Marxism played a crucial role in his defection, personal and psychological
            factors were also influential. He later noted that his time in Japan prompted his
            realization that something was fundamentally wrong with the system, which he believed
            Marxism might address.
            
            Conversely, acquaintances suggested that his defection had deeper psychological motivations.
            After arriving in the Soviet Union, Oswald communicated with his brother Robert, indicating
            that his motivations were not solely ideological but intertwined with personal quests
            for identity and belonging.

            ... I could never have been personally happy in the U.S.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I will never return to the United States which is a country I hate.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Ask me and I will tell you I fight for communism.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            Happiness is not based on oneself, it does not consist of a small home, of taking
            and getting, Happiness is taking part in the struggle, where there is no borderline
            between one's own personal world, and the world in general.
            
            
            
            Oswald expressed a profound sense of belonging to the Soviet Union, stating it was
            a place he had always considered his own and that he sought freedom there, contrasting
            it with his strong feelings of hatred for the United States. He articulated his disdain
            for the American government in a letter to his brother Robert, explaining his belief
            that it exploited workers and suppressed their potential through various societal
            tools.
            
            His desire to live in the Soviet Union was accompanied by a strong anti-American sentiment,
            as shown in his writings. Oswald detailed his belief that the U.S. government was
            responsible for injustices such as segregation and military interventions, declaring
            his commitment to communism as a means to address these issues.
            
            Oswald’s perspective on happiness highlighted his conviction that true fulfillment
            came from participating in collective struggles rather than seeking individual material
            gain. This philosophy was part of what motivated him to defect, as he believed the
            Soviet Union represented a revolutionary society where he could align his ideals with
            a greater purpose.

            Lee Oswald
            I have been a pro-communist for years and yet I have never met a communist, instead
            I kept silent and observed, and what I observed plus my Marxist learning brought me
            here to the Soviet Union.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            In the event of war I would kill any American who put a uniform on in defense of the
            American government-- any American.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            That in my own mind I have no attachments of any kind in the U.S.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I am shocked!! My dreams! ... I have waited for 2 years to be accepted. My fondest
            dreams are shattered because of a petty official.
            
            
            
            Oswald expressed his long-standing commitment to communism and his belief that the
            Soviet Union was his true home, despite having never met a communist before. In a
            candid conversation with his brother Robert, he declared his willingness to take drastic
            actions against fellow Americans if war broke out, asserting that he felt no attachments
            to the United States.
            
            Following a series of disappointments in the Soviet Union, including the initial rejection
            of his application to stay, Oswald’s emotional turmoil led him to attempt suicide.
            His entries in his "Historic Diary" revealed the depth of his despair and his dramatic
            response to feeling unwelcome in a place he had idealized.
            
            Undeterred by his early setbacks, Oswald took decisive action to renounce his U.S.
            citizenship by visiting the American Embassy. Richard E. Snyder, an official there,
            recalled Oswald's confidence and determination as he presented his request to revoke
            his citizenship, marking a significant step in his commitment to living in the Soviet
            Union.

            Lee Oswald
            I have entered the Soviet Union for the express purpose of applying for citizenship
            in the Soviet Union, through the means of naturalization.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I affirm that my allegiance is to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I am a Marxist.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I leave Embassy, elated at this showdown, returning to my hotel I feel now my energies
            are not spent in vain.
            
            
            
            After formally renouncing his American citizenship, Oswald expressed his intent to
            apply for Soviet citizenship, declaring his allegiance to the U.S.S.R. He highlighted
            his political motivations for this decision, referencing the hardships faced by his
            mother as a worker. Despite never having held a civilian job, he framed his Marine
            service as an opportunity to witness "American imperialism," while also revealing
            a sense of disappointment about not attaining a higher rank.
            
            Following his request at the American Embassy, Oswald felt a renewed sense of hope
            and purpose, believing that his commitment would earn him acceptance in the Soviet
            Union. Ultimately, Soviet authorities granted him permission to stay, sending him
            to Minsk to work in a radio and television factory.
            
            While Oswald enjoyed a higher standard of living compared to many Soviet citizens,
            he still found himself envious of those in positions of authority, reminiscent of
            his experiences in the Marine Corps. This pattern of feeling slighted by others' advantages
            continued to shape his worldview even after he returned to the United States, where
            he characterized Communist Party officials as opportunists.

            Lee Oswald
            As my Russian improves I become increasingly conscious of just what sort of a society
            I live in.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I am starting to reconsider my desire about staying.
            
            
            
            During his time in Minsk, Oswald faced personal difficulties that contrasted with
            Marina's assertion of good relationships in the Soviet Union. Katherine Ford, a member
            of the Russian community in Dallas, recounted that Marina claimed everyone in Russia
            "hated him." Jeanne De Mohrenschildt noted that Oswald expressed disappointment upon
            returning, stating he "didn't find what I was looking for." George De Mohrenschildt
            speculated that Oswald's initial novelty wore off, leading to his disgust with life
            in the Soviet Union.
            
            Oswald's own "Historic Diary" provides insight into his growing unease. He noted feeling
            uncomfortable about his surroundings and increasingly aware of the societal conditions
            he experienced. His entries reflected discontent with compulsory activities, such
            as mass gymnastics and political meetings, which he found burdensome. By January 1961, he expressed a desire to leave, citing drab work conditions and a lack of recreational
            activities.
            
            Less than 18 months after his defection and shortly before meeting Marina Prusakova,
            Oswald began negotiations with the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to return to the United
            States.

            Immediately after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did not know him as such
            a man in Russia.

            In general, our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived in America.
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald's return to the United States marked a profound psychological shift. He
            was not yet 20 when he left with high hopes, and just shy of 23 when he returned,
            disillusioned. His attempt to renounce his U.S. citizenship symbolized a dramatic
            rejection of his past life, and coming back underscored the failure of his most significant
            act.
            
            Marina Oswald observed notable changes in her husband post-return, stating, "immediately
            after coming to the United States Lee changed. I did not know him as such a man in
            Russia." She noted that while he continued to help her, he became more reclusive and
            irritable, describing him as "very unrestrained and very explosive" from November 19, 1962, to March 1963. She reflected on how their family life deteriorated, attributing it to Lee's increasing
            irritability and hot-tempered nature.
            
            Comparing Oswald's writings from the Soviet Union to those after his return reveals
            a significant decline in coherence. His work "The Collective," written in the Soviet
            Union, was a clear description of his experiences in the radio and television factory,
            indicating a more organized mindset. In contrast, his autobiographical sketch reflected
            a troubled upbringing and hints at the psychological turmoil he faced upon returning
            to the U.S.

            Lee Oswald
            No man, having known, having lived, under the Russian Communist and American capitalist
            system, could possibly make a choice between them, there is no choice, one offers
            oppression the other poverty. Both offer imperialistic injustice, tinted with two
            brands of slavery.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            It is immature to take the sort of attitude which says "a curse on both your houses!"
            
            
            
            In the USMC he abandoned his American life to seek a new life in the USSR. Full of
            optimism and hope he stood in Red Square in the fall of 1959 vowing to see his chosen
            course through; after, however, two years and a lot of growing up, I decided to return
            to the USA. "The Collective" contrasts sharply with material which Oswald seems to
            have written after he left the Soviet Union, which appears to be more an expression
            of his own psychological condition than of a reasoned analysis. The latter material
            expresses great hostility to both communism and capitalism. He wrote that to a person
            knowing both of those systems, "there can be no mediation between those systems as
            they exist today and that person. He must be opposed to their basic foundations and
            representatives."

            The emplacement of a separate, democratic, pure communist society ... but one with
            union-communes, democratic socializing of production and without regard to the twisting
            apart of Marxism by other powers.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            The Communist Party of the United States has betrayed itself! It has turned itself
            into the traditional lever of a foreign power to overthrow the government of the United
            States; not in the name of freedom or high ideals, but in servile conformity to the
            wishes of the Soviet Union.
            
            
            
            Oswald's decided rejection of both capitalism and communism seemed to place him in
            a situation in which he could not live with satisfaction either in the United States
            or in the Soviet Union. While "resoulfulness and patient working towards the aforesaid
            goal's are preferred rather than loud and useless manifestations of protest," Oswald
            noted that these tactics might prove to be too limited in the near future. He expressed
            a profound disdain for both systems, describing the crimes committed by the Soviets
            and the failures of the Communist Party in the U.S.

            Lee Oswald
            I have often wondered why it is that the communist, anarchist capitalist and even
            the fascist and anarchist elements in America always profess patriotism toward the
            land and the people, if not the government; although their ideals must surely lead
            to the bitter destruction of all and everything.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            As a mark of disgust and protest against American political policies in foreign countries,
            my personal sign of discontent and horror at the misguided line of reasoning of the
            U.S. Government.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            No of course not, I have never even known a communist, outside of the ones in the
            USSR but you can't help that.
            
            
            
            Oswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return to the United States
            by preparing two sets of identical questions he thought he might face at a press conference.
            His first answers reflected his true feelings, expressing disgust with American policies,
            while his second set of answers seemed crafted to avoid harm as he resumed life in
            the U.S. This duality illustrates his ambivalence toward both his past and his new
            life.

            Jeanne De Mohrenschildt
            Oswald was very, very disagreeable and disappointed.

            Marina had a hundred dresses given to her ... he objected to that lavish help, because
            Marina was throwing it into his face.
            
            
            
            Despite his expressed hatred for the Soviet Union, Oswald remained interested in it
            after returning to the U.S. He wrote to the Soviet Embassy seeking information about
            subscriptions to Russian periodicals and even requested a visa for his return to the
            Soviet Union. His personal relations were strained; he had no close friends in Texas
            and often displayed resentment towards the help his wife received from her Russian-American
            community.

            If somebody did that to me, a lousy trick like that, to take my wife away, and all
            the furniture, I would be mad as hell, too.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I didn't have a mother, but later admitted that I did but that I didn't love her very
            much.
            
            
            
            The relationship between Oswald and Marina became strained, with Bouhe wanting to
            "liberate" her from Oswald. After a brief separation, Marina returned to Oswald, but
            communication with the Russian community ceased. Oswald also severed ties with his
            mother and brother, expressing disdain for his family, which he viewed as examples
            of the exploited under capitalism. His attitude toward family and relationships shifted
            as he adjusted to life after his return from the Soviet Union.

            Marguerite Oswald tried to help her son and his family settle into their new apartment
            but faced strong objections from Lee, particularly regarding her purchases for Marina.
            After moving to Dallas in October 1962, Lee cut off all communication with his mother until after the assassination. In
            April 1963, he sought to learn about his family background by visiting relatives in New Orleans,
            contrasting with his earlier disinterest in his father. Oswald struggled to find stable
            employment, partially due to his lack of skills and potentially due to how he presented
            his past to employers. He did manage to secure a job as a sheet metal worker but left
            voluntarily after a few months.

            Oswald made qualifying marks in 19 of 23 categories included on the general aptitude
            examination and scored 127 on the verbal test.
            
            
            
            Oswald demonstrated considerable aptitude according to his employment counselor, qualifying
            for many job types and showing outstanding verbal and clerical potential. He began
            working as a trainee at a commercial photography firm in Dallas but struggled with
            efficiency and interpersonal relations, leading to conflicts with colleagues. His
            discharge in April 1963 was hastened by his difficulties and the incident involving a Russian language newspaper.
            After moving to New Orleans in April 1963, he found work as a greaser and oiler of coffee processing machines at the William
            B. Reily Co.

            It was determined that we should not undertake to furnish employment references for
            him.
            
            
            
            After securing employment as a greaser in New Orleans, Oswald asked his wife to join
            him, while he misled them about his job, claiming to work as a commercial photographer.
            He lost that job due to unsatisfactory work and spending excessive time in the garage
            reading magazines. His activities with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee complicated
            his employment prospects, leading to negative references from previous employers.
            Eventually, he found work with the Texas School Book Depository.
            
            
            The Commission concluded that on April 10, 1963, Oswald shot at Maj. Gen. Edwin A. Walker, reflecting his inclination towards dramatic
            and violent action to express his beliefs. This shooting was planned in advance, with
            Oswald studying bus schedules and preparing his attack meticulously. He even posed
            for photographs with his rifle and relevant publications shortly before the incident.

            I kept the note to use against him if something like that should be repeated again.
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            He forgot about it. But apparently after he thought that what he had written in his
            book might be proof against him, and he destroyed it.
            
            
            
            After his attack on General Walker, Oswald left a note for Marina outlining what to
            do if he were apprehended, along with a notebook and photos of himself with the rifle.
            Marina discovered the note after becoming worried about his absence and testified
            that she was agitated and angry when Oswald revealed his actions to her. She insisted
            he promise not to repeat such behavior and kept the note as leverage.
            
            
            Marina noted that Oswald later burned his notebook, despite her advice to discard
            it beforehand. This indicates a lack of concern about keeping incriminating evidence,
            as he left behind material that could easily have implicated him had he been captured.
            His behavior suggested he might have wanted to be caught, or at least wanted his involvement
            known if he was apprehended.

            I asked him what for he was making all these entries in the book and he answered that
            he wanted to leave a complete record so that all the details would be in it.
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            He was a very bad man, that he was a fascist, that he was the leader of a fascist
            organization.
            
            
            
            The attempt on General Walker's life reveals insights into Oswald's motives for the
            assassination of Kennedy. There are notable differences in his planning and actions,
            but similarities also exist that warrant examination. The items Oswald left behind
            during his attack on Walker indicate a strong desire to document his place in history.
            If the attack had succeeded, the photographs of him with his rifle, alongside Communist
            and Socialist Worker's Party newspapers, would likely have received significant media
            coverage, paralleling the aftermath of the Kennedy assassination.
            
            
            This concern for legacy suggests that Oswald viewed his actions as historically significant.
            Despite perceptions that he was not dangerous, the Walker incident demonstrates Oswald's
            willingness and determination to carry out a planned assassination if he deemed it
            justified. His rationale for attacking Walker reflects a mindset that equated the
            general with figures like Adolf Hitler, suggesting that he believed violent action
            against perceived fascists could be justified to save lives.

            Lee Oswald's involvement with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) began in earnest
            in New Orleans, where he printed handbills under the pseudonym "Lee Osborne." These
            handbills called for "Hands Off Cuba" and promoted membership in the local FPCC chapter.
            He distributed this literature without incident on June 16, 1963, but later engaged in confrontations with anti-Castro exiles, leading to his arrest
            on multiple occasions in August 1963.
            
            
            Despite his public activities, Oswald's chapter was a figment of his imagination,
            with a fictitious president named A. J. Hidell—also the name he used to purchase the
            rifle used in the assassination. Marina Oswald testified that she was coerced into
            signing the membership card under threat. The chapter had no formal charter from the
            national FPCC, and Oswald's claims about its membership and operations were exaggerated.
            
            
            Oswald's FPCC activities reflected a desire for self-promotion and manipulation of
            public perception. His letters to the national director of the FPCC were often misleading,
            claiming substantial activity and support that did not exist. He described the closure
            of a supposed FPCC office in vague terms and inflated the number of circulars distributed,
            portraying himself as a dedicated activist despite operating in isolation.

            William Stuckey
            
            
            Despite Oswald's claims of street demonstrations being attacked, the Commission found
            no evidence supporting such incidents apart from the confrontation with Carlos Bringuier,
            which occurred after Oswald wrote to V. T. Lee. Bringuier, familiar with anti-Castro
            activities, was unaware of any such events, and police reports only documented Oswald's
            earlier, uneventful literature distribution in June.
            
            
            Oswald's subsequent letter to V. T. Lee indicated that he may have exaggerated his
            experiences, especially regarding the street demonstration. While he had stamped literature
            with "FPCC 544 Camp St. NEW ORLEANS, LA.," investigations failed to link him to that
            address, although an anti-Castro organization had operated there until early 1962.
            The Commission found no evidence that Oswald rented an office in New Orleans, nor
            did his claims of distributing "thousands" of circulars hold up, as he had printed
            only 1,000.
            
            
            In another letter dated August 17, 1963, Oswald claimed he had appeared on a television program called "Latin American Focus"
            and was subsequently inundated with calls and invitations to debate. However, WDSU
            did not air such a program; Oswald was instead briefly featured on "Latin Listening
            Post." His claim of receiving numerous calls was also exaggerated, with only one known
            caller being an associate of Bringuier trying to uncover the reality of Oswald's FPCC
            involvement.
            
            
            Oswald's aspirations for attention mirrored his earlier experiences in the Soviet
            Union and reflected his desire for notoriety upon returning to the U.S. However, the
            limited recognition he received from his activities in New Orleans left him unsatisfied,
            prompting him to embellish his accomplishments in communications with V. T. Lee.

            EVERYONE WELCOME!
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            His attempt to express himself through his Fair Play for Cuba activities, however,
            was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio debate over WDSU on August 21, 1963, brought out the history of his defection to the Soviet Union. The basic facts of
            the event were uncovered independently by William Stuckey, who arranged the debate,
            and Edward Butler, executive director of the Information Council of the Americas,
            who also appeared on the program. Oswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning
            of the debate and was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state
            that Fair Play for Cuba was "not at all Communist controlled regardless of the fact
            that I had the experience of living in Russia."
            
            
            
            Stuckey testified that uncovering Oswald's defection was very important:
            "I think that we finished him on that program... because we had publicly linked the
            Fair Play for Cuba Committee with a fellow who had lived in Russia for 3 years and
            who was an admitted Marxist."
            
            
            
            The interesting thing, or rather the danger involved, was the fact that Oswald seemed
            like such a nice, bright boy and was extremely believable before this. We thought
            the fellow could probably get quite a few members if he was really indeed serious
            about getting members. We figured after this broadcast of August 21, why, that was
            no longer possible.
            
            
            
            In spite of the fact that Oswald had been surprised and was on the defensive throughout
            the debate, according to Stuckey: "Mr. Oswald handled himself very well, as usual."
            Stuckey thought Oswald "appeared to be a very logical, intelligent fellow," and "was
            arrested by his cleancutness." He did not think Oswald looked like the "type" that
            he would have expected to find associating with a group such as the Fair Play for
            Cuba Committee.
            
            
            
            Following the disclosure of his defection, Oswald sought advice from the Communist
            Party, U.S.A., concerning his Fair Play for Cuba activity. He had previously sent,
            apparently unsolicited, to the Party newspaper, the Worker, samples of his photographic
            work, offering to contribute that sort of service without charge. The Worker replied:
            "Your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to time we shall call on you." He
            later wrote to another official of the Worker, seeking employment, and mentioning
            the praise he had received for submitting his photographic work.
            
            
            
            He presented Arnold Johnson, Gus Hall, and Benjamin J. Davis honorary membership cards
            in his nonexistent New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, and advised
            them of some of his activities on behalf of the organization.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            formation and lecture bureau of the Communist Party, U.S.A., replied stating:
            
            
            
            "It is good to know that movements in support of fair play for Cuba have developed
            in New Orleans as well as in other cities. We do not have any organizational ties
            with the Committee, and yet there is much material that we issue from time to time
            that is important for anybody who is concerned about developments in Cuba."
            
            
            
            Marina Oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered important meant
            much to Oswald. After he had begun his Cuban activity in New Orleans, "he received
            a letter from somebody in New York, some Communist--probably from New York--I am not
            sure from where--from some Communist leader and he was very happy, he felt that this
            was a great man that he had received the letter from." Since he seemed to feel that
            no one else understood his political views, the letter was of great value to him for
            it "was proof ... that there were people who understood his activity."
            
            
            
            He anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would hinder him in "the
            struggle for progress and freedom in the United States" into which Oswald, in his
            own words, had "thrown" himself. He sought advice from the central committee of the
            Communist Party, U.S.A., in a letter dated August 28, 1963, about whether he could "continue to fight, handicapped as it were, by my past record
            ... [and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground or whether in your opinion
            I should always remain in the background, i.e. underground."
            
            
            
            Stating that he had used his "position" with what he claimed to be the local branch
            of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee to "foster communist ideals," Oswald wrote that
            he felt that he might have compromised the FPCC and expressed concern lest "Our opponents
            could use my background of residence in the U.S.S.R. against any cause which I join,
            by association, they could say the organization of which I am a member, is Russian
            controlled, etc."
            
            
            
            In reply Arnold Johnson advised Oswald that, while as an American citizen he had a
            right to participate in such organizations as he wished, "there are a number of organizations,
            including possibly Fair Play, which are of a very broad character, and often it is
            advisable for some people to remain in the background, not underground."
            
            
            
            By August of 1963, after a short 3 months in New Orleans, the city in which he had been born and had
            lived most of his early life, Oswald had fallen on difficult times. He had not liked
            his job as a greaser of coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little
            over 2 months. He had not found another job. His wife was expecting their second child
            in October and there was concern about the cost which would be involved. His brief
            foray on behalf of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had failed to win any support.

            Marina Oswald
            His basic desire was to get to Cuba by any means.

            He tried very hard to please me.
            
            
            
            
            Oswald returned home on November 21, 1963, feeling lonely after not visiting the previous weekend.

            I said it would be better if I remained with Ruth until the holidays.
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            I will buy you a washing machine.
            
            
            
            
            Oswald suggested renting an apartment in Dallas, wanting to live with his wife.
            
            
            Oswald left his wedding ring and $170 in a drawer, taking only $13.87 and a long brown
            package to work.

            Marina Oswald
            He suggested that we rent an apartment in Dallas. He said that he was tired of living
            alone.
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            I told him that it would be better if I remained with Ruth until the holidays.
            
            
            Marina Oswald
            He wanted me to live with him in Dallas.
            
            
            
            Oswald's feelings of loneliness and desire for reconciliation with his wife were evident
            when he returned home, hoping to improve their relationship.

            Commission
            The Commission does not believe that the relations between Oswald and his wife caused
            him to assassinate the President.
            
            
            Commission
            Oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.
            
            
            Commission
            He sought for himself a place in history--a role as the "great man" who would be recognized
            as having been in advance of his times.
            
            
            
            The Commission concludes that Oswald's assassination of President Kennedy was driven
            by deep-seated hostility and a quest for significance, rather than simple personal
            grievances.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Lee Oswald
            
            
            
            Commission
            Oswald also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the
            consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment.
            
            
            
            The Commission concludes that various factors shaped Oswald's character, enabling
            him to carry out the assassination of President Kennedy.

            serve until December 8, 1962.458 He was assigned to the Marine Air Reserve Training Command at the Naval Air Station
            in Glenview, Ill.459
            Almost exactly 1 year later, on September 13, 1960, Oswald was given an "undesirable discharge" from the Marine Corps Reserve,460 based on:
            reliable information which indicated that he had renounced his U.S. citizenship with
            the intentions of becoming a permanent citizen of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
            Further, that petitioner brought discredit to the Marine Corps through adverse newspaper
            publicity, which was generated by the foregoing action, and had thereby, in the opinion
            of his commanding officer, proved himself unfit for retention in the naval service.461
            SOVIET UNION
            
            On September 4, the day on which he was transferred out of MACS-9 in preparation for
            his discharge, Oswald had applied for a passport at the Superior Court of Santa Ana, Calif. His application
            stated that he planned to leave the United States on September 21 to attend the Albert
            Schweitzer College and the University of Turku in Finland, and to travel in Cuba,
            the Dominican Republic, England, France Germany, and Russia.462 The passport was routinely
            issued 6 days later.463
            
            Oswald went directly home after his discharge, and arrived in Fort Worthby September 14.464 He told his mother that he intended to get a job on a ship or
            possibly in the "export-import business." 465 If he stayed in Fort Worth, he said,
            he would be able to earn only about $30 per week; on a ship, he would earn "big money"
            and be able to send substantial amounts home.466 Three days after he arrived in Fort
            Worth, he left for New Orleans.467 While he was in Fort Worthhe had registered his dependency discharge and entry into the Marine Reserve at the
            Fort WorthSelective Service Board,468 and visited his brother Robert and his family.469 He also gave his mother $100.470
            
            On September 17, Oswald spoke with a representative of Travel Consultants, Inc., a New Orleanstravel bureau; he filled out a "Passenger Immigration Questionnaire," on which he
            gave his occupation as "shipping export agent" and said that he would be abroad for
            2 months on a pleasure trip. He booked passage from New Orleansto Le Havre, France, on a freighter, the SS Marion Lykes, scheduled to sail on September
            18, for which he paid $220.75.471 On the evening of September 17, he registered at
            the Liberty Hotel.472
            
            The Marion Lykes did not sail until the early morning of September 20.473 Before its
            departure, Oswald wrote his mother a letter, which was her last news of him until she read stories
            of his defection in Fort Worthnewspapers:
            
            Page 690
            
            Dear Mother:
            
            Well, I have booked passage on a ship to Europe, I would of had to sooner or later
            and I think it's best I go now. Just remember above all else that my values are very
            different from Robert's or your's. It is difficult to tell you how I feel, Just remember this is what I
            must do. I did not tell you about my plans because you could harly be expected to
            understand.
            
            I did not see aunt Lilian while I was here. I will write again as soon as I land.
            
            Lee 474
            
            The Marion Lykes carried only four passengers.475 Oswald shared his cabin with Billy Joe Lord, a young man who had just graduated from high
            school and was going to France to continue his education. Lord testified that he and
            Oswald did not discuss politics but did have a few amicable religious arguments, in which
            Oswald defended atheism. Oswald was "standoffish," but told Lord generally about his background, mentioning that
            his mother worked in a drugstore in Fort Worthand that he was bitter about the low wages which she received. He told Lord that he
            intended to travel in Europe and possibly to attend school in Sweden or Switzerland
            if he had sufficient funds.476 The other two passengers were Lt. Col. and Mrs. George
            B. Church, Jr., who also found Oswald unfriendly and had little contact with him. Oswald told them that he had not liked the Marine Corps and that he planned to study in
            Switzerland; they observed some "bitterness" about his mother's difficulties, but
            did not discuss this with him. No one on board suspected that he intended to defect
            to Russia.477
            
            Oswald disembarked at Le Havreon October 8. He left for England that same day, and arrived on October 9.478 He told
            English customs officials in Southamptonthat he had $700 and planned to remain in the United Kingdom for 1 week before proceeding
            to a school in Switzerland. But on the same day, he flew to Helsinki, Finland, where
            he registered at the Torni Hotel; on the following day, he moved to the Klaus Kurki
            Hotel.479
            
            Oswald probably applied for a visa at the Russian consulate on October 12, his first business
            day in Helsinki.480 The visa was issued on October 14. It was valid until October
            20 and permitted him to take one trip of not more than 6 days to the Soviet Union.481
            He also purchased 10 Soviet "tourist vouchers" which cost $30 apiece.482 He left Helsinkiby train on the following day, crossed the Finnish-Russian border at Vainikkala, and
            arrived in Moscowon October 16.483
            
            He was met at the Moscowrailroad station by a representative of "Intourist," the state tourist agency, and
            taken to the Hotel Berlin, where he registered as a student.484 On the same day he
            met the Intourist guide assigned to him during his stay in Russia, a young woman named
            Rima Shirokova. They went sightseeing the next day. Almost immediately he told her that he wanted
            to leave
            
            Page 691
            
            the United States and become a citizen of the Soviet Union. According to Oswald's "Historic Diary," she later told him that she had reported his statement to Intourist
            headquarters, which in turn had notified the "Passport and Visa Office" (probably
            the Visa and Registration Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the MVD
            485). She was instructed to help Oswald prepare a letter to the Supreme Soviet requesting that he be granted citizenship.
            Oswald mailed such a letter that same day.486 (The "Historic Diary" is Oswald's handwritten account of his life in Russia.487 The earlier entries were written
            after the events which they describe; later, in Minsk, he probably kept a contemporaneous
            record of his experiences. 488 The Commission has used the diary, which Oswald may have written with future readers in mind, only as Oswald's record of his private life and personal impressions as he sought to present them
            and has relied wherever possible on official documents, correspondence, and the testimony
            of witnesses.)
            
            The diary records that when Oswald told Rima Shirokova that he intended to defect she was "flabbergassted," but agreed to help.489 She was
            "politly sympathetic but uneasy" when he told her that he wanted to defect because
            he was "a Communist, ect." 490 As an Intourist guide, Rima toured parts of Moscowwith Oswald in the next few days. His primary concern, however, appeared to be his effort to
            become a Soviet citizen, and she also aided him in his dealings with the Soviet Government.491
            He thought that Rima felt sorry for him and tried to be a friend because he was "someth. new." 492 On
            his 20th birthday, 2 days after he arrived in Russia, she gave him Dostoevski's "The
            Idiot," 493 in which she had written: "Dear Lee, Great congratulations! Let all your
            dreams come true! 18.X 1959" 494
            
            On October 19, Oswald was probably interviewed in his hotel room by a man named Lev Setyayev, who said
            that he was a reporter for Radio Moscowseeking statements from American tourists about their impressions of Moscow,495 but
            who was probably also acting for the KGB.496 Two years later, Oswald told officials at the American Embassy that he had made a few routine comments to
            Setyayev of no political signifiance. The interview with Setyayev may, however, have
            been the occasion for an attempt by the KGB, in accordance with regular practice,
            to assess Oswald or even to elicit compromising statements from him; the interview was apparently
            never broadcast.497 (As discussed in ch. VI of this report, the Commission is aware
            that many of the Soviet officials with whom Oswald came into contact were employees of the KGB, the agency which has primary jurisdiction
            for the treatment of defectors.)
            
            On the following day, Rima Shirokova told him that the "Pass. and Visa Dept." wanted to see him,498 and on the morning
            of October 21, he was interviewed by an official concerning his application for citizenship.
            The official offered little information and no encouragement; he told Oswald only that he would check to see if the visa could
            
            Page 692
            
            be extended. Oswald returned to the Hotel Berlin.499 That afternoon, he was notified that his visa had
            expired and that he had to leave Moscowwithin 2 hours.500
            
            Oswald responded to the unfavorable decision by cutting himself above his left, wrist, in
            an apparent suicide attempt. Rima Shirokova found him unconscious in his hotel room and had him taken to the Botkinskaya Hospital.
            His diary states: "Poor Rimmea stays by my side as interrpator (my Russian is still
            very bad) far into the night, I tell her 'Go home' (my mood is bad) but she stays,
            she is 'my friend.'" 501
            
            For 3 days Oswald was confined in the psychiatric ward of the hospital. He was examined by a psychiatrist,
            who concluded that he was not dangerous to other people and could be transferred to
            the "somatic" department. Hospital records containing the results of the examination
            502 state that Oswald came to Russia in order to apply for citizenship, and that "in order to postpone
            his departure he inflicted the injury upon himself." 503 They note that Oswald understood some Russian and, presumably based on information which he provided, that
            he had "graduated from a technical high school in radio technology and radio electronics."
            504 The record states: "He claims he regrets his action. After recovering he intends
            to return to his homeland." 505
            
            Oswald resented being in the psychiatric ward and told Rima Shirokova that he wanted a transfer.506 She visited him at the hospital frequently and his
            diary records that "only at this moment" did he "notice [that] she is preety." 507
            Another entry for the hospital period says: "Afternoon I am visited by Roza Agafonova
            of the hotel tourist office, who askes about my health, very beautiful, excelant Eng.,
            very merry and kind, she makes me very glad to be alive." 508 These entries reflect
            an attitude gentler and friendlier than his attitude before the suicide attempt, when
            he seemed to be coldly concerned only with his status in Russia. Once Oswald was out of the psychiatric ward, he found the hospital more pleasant. The new ward,
            which he shared with 11 other patients, was "airy," and the food was good. His only
            complaint, according to his diary, was that an "elderly American" patient was distrustful
            of him because he had not registered at the American Embassy and because he was evasive
            about the reasons for his presence in Moscowand confinement in the hospital.509
            
            He was released from the hospital on October 28,510 and, accompanied by Rima Shirokova, was driven to the Hotel Berlinin an Intourist car. After he said goodby to Lyudmila Dmitrieva, head of the In-tourist
            office at the Berlin, and to Roza Agafonova, another Intourist employee at the hotel,
            he checked out of the Berlin and registered at the Metropole, 511 a large hotel under
            the same administration as the Berlin.512 The Government had undoubtedly directed
            him to make the change. His visa had expired while he was in the hospital, and his
            presence in Russia was technically illegal; he had received no word that the decision
            that he must leave had been reversed. Later that day, however, Rima told him that the "Pass and Registration Office" wished
            
            Page 693
            
            to talk to him about his future.513 According to the diary, when Oswald appeared at the office he was asked whether he still wanted to become a Soviet citizen
            and he replied that he did; he provided his Marine Corps discharge papers for identification.
            He was told that he could not expect a decision soon, and was dismissed. During this
            interview, Oswald was apparently questioned about the interview which preceded his hospitalization,
            which led him to conclude that there had been no communication between the two sets
            of officials.514 That evening he met Rima, on whom he vented his frustration at being put off by the authorities.515
            
            Oswald ate only once on the following day; he stayed near the telephone, fully dressed and
            ready to leave immediately if he were summoned. He remained in his room for 3 days,
            which seemed to him "like three years," 516 until October 31, when he decided to act.
            He met Rima Shirokova at noon and told her that he was impatient, but did not say what he planned to do;
            she cautioned him to stay in his room "and eat well." 517 She left him after a short
            while and, a few minutes later, he took a taxi to the American Embassy, where he asked
            to see the consul. (See Commission Exhibits Nos. 24, 912, 913, pp. 264, 263, 261.)
            When the receptionist asked him first to sign the tourist register, he laid his passport
            on the desk and said that he had come to "dissolve his American citizenship." Richard
            E. Snyder, the Second Secretary and senior consular official,518 was summoned, and he invited
            Oswald into his office.519
            
            Oswald's meeting with Snyder, at which Snyder's assistant, John A. McVickar, was also present, is more fully discussed in appendix
            XV to the Commission's report. Oswald declared that he wanted to renounce his American citizenship; he denounced the United
            States and praised the Government of the Soviet Union. Over Oswald's objections, Snyder sought to learn something of Oswald's motives and background and to forestall immediate action. Oswald told him that he had already offered to tell a Soviet official what he had learned
            as a radar operator in the Marines. The interview ended when Snyder told Oswald that he could renounce his citizenship on the following Monday, 2 days later, if
            he would appear personally to do so. During the interview, Oswald handed to Snyder a note 520 which suggests that he had studied and sought to comply with section 349
            of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which provides for loss of American citizenship.521
            The note contains paragraphs which read like inartistic attempts to cast off citizenship
            in three of the ways specified by the statute. The attempts failed but there is no
            reason to doubt that they were sincere. Snyder has testified that he believed that Oswald would immediately have formally renounced his citizenship had he been permitted to
            do so.522
            
            The interview lasted for less than an hour. Oswald returned to his hotel angry about the delay but "elated" by the "showdown" and sure
            that he would be permitted to remain after his "sign of ... faith" in the Russians.523
            Soon after he returned to the hotel, he was
            
            Page 694
            
            approached by A. I. Goldberg, a reporter for the Associated Press, whom the Embassy
            had told about Oswald's actions. Oswald refused to speak to him.524 He answered a few questions for two other reporters,
            R. J. Korengold and Miss Aline Mosby, but again refused to be interviewed.525 Thereafter, the news services made repeated
            unsuccessful attempts to interview him, which he thought was an indirect form of pressure
            from the Embassy to return to the United States.526
            
            On the day after Oswald's meeting with Snyder, his family read in the newspapers about his appearance at the Embassy and tried
            to contact him. Mrs. Oswald testified that she was shocked at her son's decision to defect but, respected his
            motives for doing so; later she suspected that he had been forcibly removed to Russia.527
            She placed a telephone call to him,528 but he either refused to speak to her 529 or
            cut her off very quickly.530 So too, on November 2, he rejected the Embassy's efforts
            to deliver or read on the telephone a telegram from his brother Robert.531 A call from Robert was either canceled before it was completed or was refused.532 Robert's telegram, along with a message asking Oswald to contact, him immediately, which Robert had asked the State Department to deliver,533 was finally sent to Oswald from the Embassy by registered mail.534
            
            A few days later, the Embassy received a letter from Oswald dated November 3 which requested that his citizenship be revoked.535 The letter stated
            that he had appeared at the Embassy "for the purpose of signing the formal papers
            to this effect" and protested against the "conduct of the official" who had refused
            him "this legal right." Oswald noted that his application for Soviet citizenship was pending and said that if it
            were granted he would ask the Soviet Government "to lodge a formal protest" on his
            behalf.536 The Embassy replied on November 9 that Oswald could renounce his citizenship by appearing at the Embassy and executing the necessary
            papers.537
            
            Oswald's diary describes the period from November 2 to November 15, during which he continued
            to isolate himself, as "days of utter loneliness." 538 On November 8, he wrote to
            his brother:
            
            Dear Robert
            
            Well, what shall we talk about, the weather perhaps? Certainly you do not wish me
            to speak of my decision to remain in the Soviet Union and apply for citizenship here,
            since I'm afraid you would not be able to comprehend my reasons. You really dent know
            anything about me. Do you know for instance that I have waited to do this for well
            over a year, do you know that I ... [phrase in Russian] speak a fair amount of Russian
            which I have been studing for many months.
            
            I have been told that I will not have to leave the Soviet Union if I do not care to.
            this than is my decision. I will not leave this country, the Soviet Union, under any
            conditions, I will never return to the United States which is a country I hate.
            
            Someday, perhaps soon, and than again perhaps in a few years, I will become a citizen
            of the Soviet Union, but it is a very legal
            
            Page 695
            
            process, in any event, I will not have to leave the Soviet Union and I will never
            ... [word missing].
            
            I recived your telegram and was glad to hear from you, only one word bothered me,
            the word "mistake." I assume you mean that I have made a "mistake" it is not for you
            to tell me that you cannot understand my reasons for this very action.
            
            I will not speak to anyone from the United States over the telephone since it may
            be taped by the Americans.
            
            If you wish to corespond with me you can write to the below address, but I really
            don't, see what we could take about if you want to send me money, that I can us, but
            I do not expect to be able to send it back.
            
            LEE 589
            
            Oswald's statement that he had been told that he could remain in Russia was not true. According
            to his diary, he was not told until later that he could remain even temporarily in
            Russia,540 and only in January was he told the he could remain indefinitely.541 The
            Embassy tried to deliver a typed copy of a telegram from his brother John on November
            9; Oswald refused to answer the knock on his door, and the message was then sent to him by
            registered mail.542
            
            Toward the end of this waiting period, probably on November 13, Aline Mosby succeeded in interviewing Oswald.543 A reporter for United Press International, she had called him on the telephone
            and was told to come right over, Oswald's explanation being that he thought she might "understand and be friendly" because
            she was a woman.544 She was the first person who was not a Soviet citizen to whom
            he granted an interview since his meeting with Snyder at the Embassy on October 31. Miss Mosby found him polite but stiff; she said that be seemed full of confidence, often showing
            a "small smile, more like a smirk," and that he talked almost "non-stop." Oswald said to her that he had been told that he could remain in the Soviet Union and that
            job possibilities were being explored; they thought it probably would be best, he
            said, to continue his education. He admitted that his Russian was bad but was confident
            that it would improve rapidly. He based his dislike for the United States on his observations
            of racial prejudice and the contrast between "the luxuries of Park Avenue and workers'
            lives on the East Side," and mentioned his mother's poverty; he said that if he had
            remained in the United States he too would have become either a capitalist or a worker.
            "One way or another." he said, "I'd lose in the United States. In my own mind, even
            if I'd be exploiting other workers. That's why I chose Marxist ideology."
            
            Oswald told his interviewer that he had been interested in Communist theory since he was
            15, when "an old lady" in New York handed him "a pamphlet about saving the Rosenbergs."
            But when Mosby asked if he were a member of the Communist Party he said that he had never met a
            Communist and that he "might bare seen" one only once, when he saw that "old lady."
            He told her that while
            
            Page 696
            
            he was in the Marine Corps he had seen American imperialism in action, and had saved
            $1,500 in secret preparation for his defection to Russia. His only apparent regrets
            concerned his family: his mother, whom he had not told of his plans, and his brother,
            who might lose his job as a result of the publicity.545
            
            The interview lasted for about 2 hours. According to Oswald's own account, he exacted a promise from Miss Mosby that she would show him the story before publication but she broke the promise; he
            found the published story to contain distortions of his words.546 Miss Mosby's notes indicate that he called her to complain of the distortions, saying in particular
            that his family had not been "poverty-stricken" and that his defection was not prompted
            by personal hardship but that was "a matter only of ideology."
            
            According to the diary, Oswald was told in mid-November that he could remain temporarily in Russia "until some solution
            was found with what to do" with him. 548 Armed with this "comforting news," 549 he
            granted a second interview, again to a woman, on November 16.550 Miss Priscilla Johnson
            of the North American Newspaper Alliance knocked on the door of his room at the Metropole,
            and Oswald agreed to come to her room at the hotel that evening. This interview lasted about
            5 hours, from 9 p.m. until about 2 in the morning. During the interview he frequently
            mentioned the fact that he would be able to remain in Russia, which gave him great
            pleasure, but he also showed disappointment about the difficulties standing in the
            way of his request for Soviet citizenship. He repeated most of the information he
            had given Aline Mosby and again denied having been a member of the Communist Party or even ever having
            seen a Communist in the United States. When Miss Johnson asked him to specify some
            of the socialist writers whose works he had read during the past 5 years, he could
            name only Marx and Engels; the only title he could recall was "Das Kapital." They
            talked for a long while about Communist economic theory, which Miss Johnson thought
            was "his language"; she became convinced that his knowledge of the subject was very
            superficial.551 He commented that the Russians treated his defection as a "legal formality,"
            neither encouraging nor discouraging it.552 When she suggested that if he really wished
            to renounce his American citizenship he could do so by returning to the Embassy, he
            said that he would "never set foot in the Embassy again," since he was sure that he
            would be given the "same run-around" as before. He seemed to Miss Johnson to be avoiding
            effective renunciation, consciously or unconsciously, in order to preserve his right
            to reenter the United States.553
            
            For the rest of the year, Oswald seldom left his hotel room where he had arranged to take his meals, except perhaps
            for a few trips to museums. He spent most of his time studying Russian, hours a day"
            his diary records. The routine was broken only by another interview at the passport
            office; occasional visits from Rima Shirokova; lessons in Russian from her and other Intourist guides; and a New Year's visit from
            Roza Agafonova, who gave
            
            Page 697
            
            him a small "Boratin" clown as a New Year's present.554 He replied to a letter from
            Robert in a letter quoted at length in chapter VII of this report which contains his most
            bitter statements against the United States.555 Robert received a third letter on December 17, in which Oswald said that he would not write again and did not wish Robert to write to him. The letter concluded:
            
            I am starting a new life and I do not wish to have anything to do with the old life.
            
            I hope you and your family will always be in good health.
            
            Lee 556
            
            His mother mailed him a personal check for $20 dated December 18. It was returned
            to her on January 5 with the notation that he could not "use this check, of course";
            he asked her to send him $20 in cash and added that he had little money and needed
            "the rest," presumably a reference to the $100 he had given her in September. Mrs.
            Oswald later sent him a money order for about $25.557
            
            On January 4, Oswald was summoned to the Soviet Passport Office and given Identity Document for Stateless
            Persons No. 811479.558 He was told that he was being sent to Minsk,559 an industrial
            city located about 450 miles southwest of Moscowand with a population in 1959 of about 510,000.560 His disappointment that he had
            not been granted Soviet citizenship was balanced by relief that the uncertainty was
            ended; he told Rima Shirokova that he was happy.561 On the following day, he went to a Government agency which
            the Russians call the "Red Cross"; it gave him 5,000 rubles (about 500 new rubles,
            or $500 at the official exchange rate).562 He used 2,200 rubles to pay his hotel bill
            and 150 rubles to purchase a railroad ticket to Minsk. 563
            
            Oswald arrived in Minsk on January 7. He was met at the station by two "Red Cross" workers
            who took him to the Hotel Minsk. Two Intourist employees, both of whom spoke excellent
            English, were waiting for him.564 One of them, a young woman named Roza Kuznetsova,
            became his close friend and attended his 21st birthday party in October 1960.565 (See
            Commission Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.) On the following day, Oswald met the "Mayor," who welcomed him to Minsk, promised him a rent-free apartment, and
            warned him against "uncultured persons" who sometimes insulted foreigners.566
            
            Oswald reported for work at the Belorussian Radio and Television Factory on January 13.567
            Two days earlier he had visited the factory and met Alexander Ziger, a Polish Jew
            who had emigrated to Argentina in 1938 and went to Russia in 1955. Ziger was a department
            head at the factory; he spoke English, and he and his family became good friends of
            Oswald and corresponded with him after his return to the United States.568 The factory,
            a major producer of electronic parts and systems, employed about 5,000 persons.569
            Oswald's union card described him as a "metal worker"; 570 Marina testified that he fashioned parts on a lathe.571 As Oswald later described it, the shop in
            
            Page 698
            
            which he worked, called the "experimental shop," 572 employed 58 workers and 5 foremen.
            It was located in the middle part of the factory area in a 2-story building made of
            red brick. The workday began at 8 o'clock sharp. Work was assigned according to "pay
            levels," which were numbered from one to five plus a top "master" level. A worker
            could ask to be tested for a higher level at any time.573
            
            Oswald had hoped to continue his education in Russia, and was disappointed by his assignment
            to a factory.574 His salary varied from 700 to perhaps as high as 900 rubles per month
            ($70-$90) Although high compared with the salaries of certain professional groups
            in Russia, which in some areas have not grown proportionately with the wages of factory
            workers,576 his salary was normal for his type of work.577 It was supplemented, however,
            by 700 rubles per month, which he received from the "Red Cross," and, according to
            Oswald, his total income was about equal to that of the director of the factory.578 In August
            he applied for membership in the union; he became a dues-paying member in September.580
            
            Undoubtedly more noteworthy to most Russians than his extra income was the attractive
            apartment which Oswald was given in March 1959. It was a small flat with a balcony overlooking the river,581
            for which he paid only 60 rubles a month.582 (See Commission Exhibit No. 2606, p.
            271.) Oswald describes it in his diary as "a Russian-dream." 583 Had Oswald been a Russian worker, he would probably have had to wait for several years for a
            comparable apartment, and would have been given one even then only if he had a family.584
            The "Red Cross" subsidy and the apartment were typical of the favorable treatment
            which the Soviet Union has given defectors.585
            
            Oswald's diary records that he enjoyed his first months in Minsk. His work at the factory
            was easy and his coworkers were friendly and curious about life in the United States;
            he declined an invitation to speak at a mass meeting. He took Roza Kuznetsova, his
            interpreter and language teacher,586 to the theater, a movie, or an opera almost every
            night, until he moved into his apartment and temporarily lost contact with her. He
            wrote in his diary, "I'm living big and am very satisfied." 587 In March or April,
            he met Pavel Golovachev, a co-worker at the factory, whom Oswald described as intelligent and friendly and an excellent radio technician. (See Commission
            Exhibit No. 2609, p. 271.) Oswald helped Golovachev with English.588 They became friends,589 and corresponded after
            Oswald returned to the United States until at least as late as September 1963.590
            
            The spring and summer passed easily and uneventfully. There were picnics and drives
            in the country, which Oswald described as "green beauty." 591 On June 18, he obtained a hunting license and soon
            afterward purchased a 16-gage single-barrel shotgun. His hunting license identifies
            him as "Aleksy Harvey Oswald." (He was called "Alec" by his Russian friends, because "Lee" sounded foreign to
            them and was difficult for them to pronounce.)592 He joined a local chapter of the
            Belorussian Society of Hunters and Fishermen, a hunting club sponsored by his factory,
            and hunted for small game in the
            
            Page 699
            
            farm regions around Minsk about half a dozen times in the summer and fall. The hunters
            spent the night in small villages and often left their bag with the villagers; Oswald described the peasant life which he saw as crude and poor.593 Sometime in June, he
            met. Ella German, a worker at the factory, of whom he later said he "perhaps fell
            in love with her the first minute" he saw her.594 (See Commission Exhibit No. 2609,
            p. 271.)
            
            At the same time, however, the first signs of disillusionment with his Russian life
            appeared. He noted in his diary that he felt "uneasy inside" after a friend took him
            aside at a party and advised him to return to the United States.595 Another entry
            compared life in Minsk with military life:
            
            I have become habituatated to a small care which is where I dine in the evening. The
            food is generaly poor and always eactly the same, menue in any care, at any point
            in the city. The food is cheap and I don't really care about quiality after three
            years in the U.S.M.C.596
            
            In an entry for August-September, he wrote that he was becoming "increasingly concious
            of just what sort of a society" he lived in.597
            
            He spent New Year's Day at the home of Ella German and her family. They ate and drank
            in a friendly atmosphere, and he was "drunk and happy" when he returned home. During
            the walk back to his apartment he decided to ask Ella to marry him. On the following
            night, after he had brought her home from the movies, he proposed on her doorstep.
            She rejected him, saying that she did not love him and that she was afraid to marry
            an American. She said that the Polish intervention in the 1920's had led to the arrest
            of all people in the Soviet Union of Polish origin and she feared that something similar
            might happen to Americans some day. Oswald was "too stunned to think," and concluded that she had gone out with him only because
            she was envied by the other girls for having an American as an escort.598 But in one
            of the entries in the diary he appears to have attributed her failure to love him
            to "a state of fear which was always in the Soviet Union." 599 His affection for Ella
            German apparently continued for some time; 600 he had his last formal date with her
            in February and remained on friendly terms with her as long as he was in Russia.601
            
            After he returned to the United States, Oswald often commented on Russian life. He discussed the Soviet systems of public education
            and medical care.603 He observed to one acquaintance that everyone in Russia was trained
            to do something,604 and discussed with another the system of regular wage and salary
            increases.605 His most frequent criticisms concerned the contrast between the lives
            of ordinary workers and the lives of Communist Party members. He told an acquaintance
            in Dallas that the working class in the Soviet Union made just about enough to buy
            clothing and food and that only party members could afford luxuries.606 On another
            occasion, he remarked
            
            Page 700
            
            that if he had as much money as some of the "managers," he could have visited the
            Black Sea resorts.607 He complained about the lack of freedom in Russia; 608 the lack
            of opportunity to travel; 609 inadequate housing; 610 and the chronic scarcity of
            food products.611 To one acquaintance, he observed that the party members were all
            "opportunists," who "shouted the loudest and made the most noise," but who were interested
            only in their own welfare.612
            
            He expressed similar views in a manuscript which he worked on in Russia 613 and probably
            intended to publish; soon after he returned to the United States, he hired a stenographer
            to prepare a typed draft from his notes.614 Oswald described the manuscript, which amounted to 50 typed pages, as "a look into the lives
            of work-a-day average Russians."615
            
            The manuscript describes the factory in which Oswald worked and suggests that political considerations of which Oswald disapproved dominated its operation. He attributed the lack of unemployment to the
            shortage of labor-saving machinery and the heavy load of bureaucracy, which kept "tons
            of paper work" flowing in and out of the factory and required a high foreman-worker
            ratio.616 In addition, he wrote, there was "a small army of examiners, committees,
            and supply checkers and the quality-control board."
            
            He described life in Russia, including life at the factory, as centered around the
            "Kollective." The head of the Kollective in his shop, Comrade Lebizen, saw to it that
            everyone maintained shop discipline, attended party meetings, and received all the
            new propaganda as it came out. He hung the walls of the shop with signs and slogans
            of the Communist Party. Meetings of the Kollective were "so numerous as to be staggering."
            In a single month, there were scheduled one meeting of the professional union, four
            political information meetings, two young Communist meetings, one meeting of the production
            committee to discuss ways of improving work, two Communist Party meetings, four meetings
            of the "School of Communist Labor," and one sports meeting. All but one of them were
            compulsory for Communist Party members and all but three were compulsory for everyone.618
            (Marina Oswald testified that her husband did not attend the courses in Marxism and Leninism given
            in the factory for party members and those who wished to become party members.)619
            They were scheduled so as not to interfere with work, and lasted anywhere from 10
            minutes to 2 hours. Oswald said that no one liked the meetings, which were accepted "philosophically"; at the
            political meetings especially, everyone paid strict attention, and party members were
            posted in the audience to watch for the slightest sign that one's attention might
            relax, even for a moment.620
            
            Oswald wrote that the "spontaneous" demonstrations on Soviet holidays or for distinguished
            visitors were almost as well organized as the Kollectivist meetings at the factory.621
            He noted that elections were supervised to ensure that everyone voted, and that they
            voted for the candidates of the Communist Party. The manuscript touches on other aspects
            of Soviet life--as the housing shortage and the corrup-
            
            Page 701
            
            tion which it evoked, the "rest-homes" where workers had their vacations, television
            and the omnipresent radio, and Russian reading habits.622 This writing also may include
            only what Oswald thought might be acceptable.
            
            On January 4, 1961, I year after he had been issued his "stateless" residence permit, Oswald was summoned to the passport office in Minsk and asked if he still wanted to become
            a Soviet citizen. He replied that he did not, but asked that his residence permit
            be extended for another year.623 The entry in his diary for January 4-31 reads: "I
            am stating to reconsider my disire about staying. The work is drab. The money I get
            has nowhere to be spent. No nightclubs or bowling allys, no places of recreation acept
            the trade union dances. I have had enough." 624
            
            The American Embassy in Moscowhad not heard from Oswald after it received his letter of November 3, 1959.625 On February 13, 1961, it received an undated letter from him which had been mailed in Minsk about a week
            earlier. He asked for the return of his passport and stated that he wanted to return
            to the United States if he could "come to some agreement [with the American Government]
            concerning the dropping of any legal proceedings" against him. He noted that he had
            not become a Soviet citizen and was living in Russia with "nonpermanent type papers
            for a foreigner," and said that he did not appear personally because he could not
            leave Minsk without permission. The letter concluded: "I hope that in recalling the
            responsibility I have to America that you remember yours in doing everything you can
            to help me, since I am an American citizen." 626 In this letter, Oswald referred to a previous letter which he said had gone unanswered; there is evidence
            that such a letter was never sent.627
            
            The Second Secretary, Richard Snyder, answered on February 28 that Oswald would have to appear at the Embassy personally to discuss his return to the United
            States.628 In the meantime, Oswald's mother, who in January had inquired at the Department of State about his whereabouts,629
            had been notified of his letter.630 A second letter from Oswald, posted on March 5, reached the Embassy on March 20; it reiterated that he was unable
            to leave Minsk without permission and asked that "preliminary inquiries ... be put
            in the form of questionnaire" and sent to him.631 His diary entry for this period
            records his "state of expectation about going back to the U.S.," and adds that a friend
            had approved his plans but warned him not to discuss them with others.632 (The Soviet
            authorities had undoubtedly intercepted and read the correspondence between Oswald and the Embassy and knew of his plans.633 Soon after the correspondence began, his
            monthly payments from the "Red Cross" were cut off.)634 Having informed Washington,635
            the Embassy wrote to Oswald on March 24, stating again that he would have to come to Moscow.636 Later, the Department
            of State decided that Oswald's passport should be returned to him only if he appeared at the Embassy for it and
            the Embassy was satisfied, after exploring the matter with him, that he had not renounced
            his citizenship.637
            
            Page 702
            
            Sometime in the second week of March, Miss Katherine Mallory, who was on tour in Minsk
            with the University of Michigan symphonic band, found herself surrounded by curious
            Russian citizens. A young man who identified himself as a Texan and former marine
            stepped out of the crowd and asked if she needed an interpreter; he interpreted for
            her for the next 15 or 20 minutes. Later he told her that he despised the United States
            and hoped to stay in Minsk for the rest of his life. Miss Mallory is unable to swear
            that her interpreter was Oswald, but is personally convinced that it was he.638
            
            A few days later, probably on March 17, Oswald attended a trade union dance with a friend, Erik Titovyets, at the Palace of Culture
            for Professional Workers in Minsk.639 The dance followed a lecture by a Russian woman
            who had recently returned from a trip to the United States.640 Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova arrived too late to hear the lecture 641 but was at the dance. Oswald noticed her and asked Yuriy Merezhinskiy, the son of the lecturer and a friend of
            both Oswald and Marina, to introduce him to her. Oswald asked her to dance. According to the diary, they liked each other immediately and
            he obtained her telephone number before she left.642 Marina testified that she told Oswald that she might see him at another dance, but did not give him her telephone number.643
            Oswald was smitten.644
            
            Marina Prusakova was 19 years old when she met Oswald. (See Commission Exhibit No. 1395, p. 270.) She was born on July 17, 1941, at Severodvinsk (formerly Molotovsk),Arkhangel Oblast', Russia.645 A few years later,
            her mother, Klavdiya Vasilievna Prusakova, married Aleksandr Ivanovich Medvedev, who
            became the only father Marina knew.646 While she was still a young girl, Marina went to Arkhangel'sk, Arkhangel Oblast', to live with her maternal grandparents,
            Tatyana Yakovlevna Prusakova and Vasiliy Prusakov. Her grandfather died when Marina was about 4 years old; she continued to live with her grandmother for some time.647
            When she was not more than 7, she moved to Zguritva, Moldavian SSR (formerly called
            Bessarabia) to live with her mother and stepfather, who was an electrical worker.648
            In 1952, the family moved to Leningrad,649 where her stepfather obtained a job in
            a power station.650 Marina testified that neither he nor her mother was a member of the Communist Party.651
            
            In Leningrad, Marina attended the Three Hundred and Seventy-Fourth Women's School. After she had completed
            the seventh grade at the school in 1955,652 she entered the Pharmacy Teknikum for
            special training, which she had requested on the ground that her mother was ill and
            Marina might need to have a specialty in order to support herself. While she was st the
            Teknikum, she joined the Trade Union for Medical Workers 653 and, in her last year
            there, worked part time in the Central Pharmacy in Leningrad. She graduated from the
            Teknikum with a diploma in pharmacy in June 1959.
            
            Marina's mother had died in 1957, during Marina's second year at the Teknikum; she continued to live with her stepfather, but had
            little contact with him. She testified that she did not get along with
            
            Page 703
            
            her stepfather, whom she displeased by her fresh conduct; she said that she was not
            easily disciplined 654 and was a source of concern to him.655 Because of the friction
            between them, Marina regarded her childhood as an unhappy one.
            
            After her graduation, Marina was assigned to a job preparing and packing orders in a pharmaceutical warehouse
            in Leningrad; as a new employee she had the right to leave this job within 3 days
            after the assignment,656 and she did so after the first day. She took no job for the
            next 2 months, at the end of which she went to live in Minsk with an aunt and uncle,
            the Prusakova, who had no children. She had known them since she was a child and there
            was a mutual affection between her and them.657 Her uncle, a member of the Communist
            Party,658 was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and headed the local bureau
            concerned with lumber. The Prusakova had one of the best apartments in a building
            reserved for MVD employees.659
            
            Marina was 18 when she arrived in Minsk. She had boyfriends in Leningrad but was not interested
            in marriage. In October 1960 she started work in the drug section of the Third Clinical
            Hospital where she earned about 450 rubles per month;660 at about the same time she
            became a member of the local Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.661 Her friends
            were mostly students, whose social life consisted of meeting in cafes to sip coffee,
            read newspapers, gossip, and carry on discussions. The group of friends "ran together,"
            and Marina did not attach herself to a particular boyfriend. She enjoyed this life, which she
            had been leading for about 7 months when she met Oswald at the dance at the Palace of Culture in March 1961.662
            
            When Marina met Oswald, she thought he was from one of the Russian-speaking Baltic countries because he
            spoke with an accent; later that same evening she learned that he was an American.663
            She met him again at another dance a week later. 664 They danced together most of
            the evening, at the end of which he walked home with her. They arranged to meet again
            the following week. 665 Before the scheduled time, Oswald called to say that he was in the hospital and that Marina should visit him there. 666 Medical records furnished to the Commission by the Russian
            Government show that Oswald was admitted to the Clinical Hospital--Ear, Nose, and Throat Division, on Thursday,
            March 30, 1961.667 Marina visited him often,668 taking advantage of her uniform to visit him outside regular
            visiting hours, which were only on Sunday. 669 On Easter Sunday, the first Sunday
            after his admission to the hospital, she brought him an Easter egg.670 On a subsequent
            visit, he asked her to be his fiancee, and she agreed to consider it.671 He left the
            hospital on April 11.672
            
            During these visits, Marina apparently discussed with Oswald his reasons for coming to Russia and his current status. According to her later account,
            he told her that he had surrendered his American documents to the Embassy in Moscowand had told American officials that he did not intend to return to the United States.
            He did not say definitely that he was no longer an American citizen, but said in answer
            
            Page 704
            
            to a question about his citizenship that he could not return to the United States.673
            
            Oswald visited Marina regularly at her aunt and uncle's apartment; they were apparently not disturbed by
            the fact that, he was an American and did not disapprove of her seeing him. He continued
            to ask her to marry him and, according to her recollection, she accepted his proposal
            on April 20; 674 Oswald's diary puts the date 5 days earlier.675 Marina testified that she believed that Oswald could not return to, the United States when she agreed to marry him, and that she
            had not married him in hope of going to the United States.676
            
            After filing notice of their intent to marry at the registrar, obtaining the special
            consent necessary for an alien to marry a citizen, and waiting the usual 10 days,
            they were married on April 30.677 The diary entry for the wedding day reads:
            
            two of Marinas girl friends act as bridesmaids. We are married. At her aunts home we have a dinner
            reception for about 20 friends and neboribos who wish us happiness (in spite of my
            origin and accept [accent?] which was in general rather disquiting to any Russian
            since for are very rare in the soviet Union even tourist. After an evening of eating
            and drinking in which ... [Marina's uncle] started a fright [fight?] and the fuse blow on an overloaded circite we
            take our leave and walk the 1-5 minutes to our home. We lived near each other, at
            midnight we were home.678
            
            They both took 3 days off from their jobs, which they spent in Minsk.679
            
            Oswald wrote in his diary for May 1, 1 day after the wedding: "In spite of fact I married
            Marina to hurt Ella I found myself in love with Marina." 680 The next entry, marked simply "May," reads in part:
            
            The trasistion of changing full love from Ella to Marina was very painfull esp. as I saw Ella almost every day at the factory but as the days
            and weeks went by I adjusted more and more [to] my wife mentaly ... She is maddly
            in love with me from the very start. Boat rides on Lake Minsk walks through the parks
            evening at home or at Aunt Valia's place mark May." 681
            
            And in June: "A continuence of May, except that; we draw closer and closer, and I
            think very little now of Ella." 682
            
            Sometime within the first month or two after they were married Oswald told his wife that he was anxious to return to the United States. The diary says
            that he told her "in the last days" of June and that she was "slightly startled" but
            encouraged him to do as he wished.683 Marina's recollection is that she learned of his plan between May and July. Embassy records
            show that Oswald notified the Embassy in a letter received on May 25 that he was married and his wife
            would
            
            Page 705
            
            seek to accompany him to the United States.684 At about this time, the Oswalds began to make inquiries in Soviet offices about exit visas. 685
            
            While these preparations were being made, the Oswalds apparently enjoyed their new life.686 They ate most of their meals in cares or at
            restaurants where they worked.687 For amusement, they went boating, attended the opera,
            concerts, the circus, and films; occasionally, they gathered with a group of friends
            for a cooperative meal at someone's apartment.688 His Russian improved, but he retained
            an accent and never learned to speak grammatically or to write well.689 He read the
            English language edition of the Daily Worker and books, also in English, on Marxism
            and Leninism; he also read some Russian newspapers.690
            
            Before he married Marina (and presumably before February, when he had begun his efforts to return to the United
            States) Oswald had applied for admission to the Patrice Lumumba Friendship University in Moscow.
            He received a letter dated May 3 apologizing for the delay in responding to his application
            and turning it down on the ground that the university had been established exclusively
            for students from the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
            691 Oswald expressed his disappointment at having been turned down to Marina.692
            
            Oswald reopened his correspondence with his family on May 5, with a friendly letter to his
            brother Robert. He said nothing about, his contacts with the American Embassy, but mentioned that
            he had married, and that he had a job as a "metal-smith" and was living well. He asked
            his brother for their mother's address, and encouraged him to come to Minsk for a
            visit.693 Robert answered the letter quickly. On May 31, Oswald wrote again and expressed his pleasure at having heard from Robert after so long. Apparently in response to an offer to send him whatever he needed,
            Oswald wrote that he needed nothing and thanked Robert for the thought; he suggested, however, that Marina might like a small wedding present. At the end of the letter he said that he did
            not know whether he would ever return to the United States; he said that before he
            could return he would have to obtain the permission of the Soviet Union for him and
            Marina to leave and insure that no charges would be lodged against him in the United States.
            In this letter, he mentioned that he was in touch with the Embassy in Moscow.694 At
            about this time, Oswald wrote also to his mother. 695
            
            On May 25, the Embassy received a letter mailed in Minsk about 10 days before, in
            which Oswald asked for assurances that he would not be prosecuted if he returned to the United
            States, and informed the Embassy that he had married a Russian woman who would want
            to accompany him.696 The Embassy communicated this development to Washington 697 and
            did not answer Oswald immediately. In addition, he had no word since March concerning the return of his
            passport. Impatient for action,698 he appeared without warning at the Embassy on July
            8; it was a Saturday and the offices were closed.699 He used the house telephone to
            reach Snyder, who came
            
            Page 706
            
            to the office, talked with him briefly, and suggested that he return on the following
            Monday.700 Oswald called Marina and asked her join him in Moscow. She arrived on Sunday, July 9, 701 a room at the
            Hotel Berlin,702 where he had stayed when he first arrived in Russia.
            
            Oswald returned to the Embassy on Monday. Marina waited outside during his interview with Snyder,703 who asked to see Oswald's Soviet papers and questioned him closely about his life in Russia and possible
            expatriating acts. Oswald stated that he was not a citizen of the Soviet Union and had never formally applied
            for citizenship, that he had never taken an oath of allegiance to the Soviet Union,
            and that he was not a member of the factory trade union organization. He said that
            he had never given Soviet officials any confidential information that he had learned
            in the Marines, had never been asked to give such information, and "doubted" that
            he would have done so had he been asked.704 Some of Oswald's statements during this interview were undoubtedly false. He had almost certainly
            applied for citizenship in the Soviet Union 705 and, at least for a time, been disappointed
            when it was denied.706 He possessed a membership card in the union organization.707
            In addition, his assertion to Snyder that he had never been questioned by Soviet authorities concerning his life in the
            United States is simply unbelievable.
            
            Oswald showed anxiety, already displayed in his letters, that he might be prosecuted and
            imprisoned if he returned to the United States. Snyder told him informally that he did not know any grounds on which he would be prosecuted
            but that he could give no assurances in this regard.708 Snyder testified that Oswald seemed to have matured while he was in Russia and did not show the bravado and arrogance
            which characterized his first contacts with the Embassy. Oswald told him that he had "learned a hard lesson the hard way" and had acquired a new
            appreciation of the United States and the meaning of freedom.709
            
            Since Oswald's passport would expire on September 10, 1961,710 before which date he probably would not be able to obtain Russian exit papers,
            he filled out an application for its renewal.711 On a questionnaire attached to the
            application,712 he reiterated his oral statements that he had obtained only a residence
            permit in the Soviet Union and was still an American national. On the basis of Oswald's written and oral statements, Snyder concluded that he had not expatriated himself and returned his passport, stamped
            valid only for direct travel to the United States,713 to him. Accompanied by his wife,714
            Oswald came to the Embassy again on the following day,715 to initiate procedures for her
            admission to the United States as an immigrant; they had a routine interview with
            McVickar, Snyder's assistant.716 Three days later, they returned to Minsk.717
            
            On the same day, Oswald wrote to his brother. He told Robert that he had his passport again and that he and Marina were doing everything possible to leave the Soviet Union. Apparently referring to
            his initial reappearance at the Embassy in quest of his passport, he
            
            Page 707
            
            wrote: "I could write a book about how many feeling have come and gone since that
            day." The letter closed with an affectionate greeting to his brother and his family.718
            The letter's tone of firm purpose to return to the United States in the face of heavy
            odds reflected Oswald's attitude thereafter.
            
            As soon as they returned to Minsk, the Oswalds began to work with local authorities for permission to leave the country.719 His
            diary entry for July 16 through August 20 reads,
            
            We have found out which blanks and certificates are nessceary to apply for a exit
            visa. They number about 20 papers; birth certificates, affidavit, photos, ect. On
            Aug 20th we give the papers out they say it will be 3.5 months before we know wheather
            they let us go or not. In the meantime Marina has had to stade 4 differant meeting at the place of work held by her boss's at the
            direction of "someone" by phone. The Young Comm. leauge headquttes also called about
            her and she had to go see them for 1-1/2 hours. The purpose (expressed) is to disuade
            her from going to the U.S.A. Net effect: Make her more stubborn about wanting to go.
            Marina is pregnet. We only hope that the visas come through soon.720
            
            In a letter dated July 15, he reported their efforts to the Embassy, and said that
            he would keep it informed "as to the overall picture." The letter mentioned that Marina was having difficulties at work because of her decision to leave but added that such
            "tactics" were "quite useless" and that Marina had "stood up well, without getting into trouble." 721 For August 21 through September
            1, the diary reads:
            
            I make repeated trips to the passport and visa office, also to Ministry of For. Affairs
            in Minsk, also Min. of Internal Affairs, all of which have a say in the granting of
            a visa. I extrackted promises of quick attention to us.722
            
            For September through October 18, "No word from Min. ('They'11 call us.')." 723
            
            Marina testified that when the news of her visit to the American Embassy in July reached
            Minsk, she was dropped from membership in "Komsomol," the Communist Youth Organization,
            724 and that "meetings were arranged" at which "members of the various organizations"
            attempted to dissuade her from leaving the Soviet Union.725 Her aunt and uncle did
            not speak to her for "a long time." 726 Paul Gregory, to whom Marina taught Russian in the United States, testified that she once referred to this period
            of her life in Minsk as "a very horrible time." 727
            
            Oswald wrote to the Embassy again on October 4, to request that the U.S. Government officially
            intervene to facilitate his and his wife's applications for exit visas.728 He stated
            that there had been "systematic and concerted attempts to intimidate [Marina] ... into with-
            
            Page 708
            
            drawing her application for a visa" which had resulted in her being hospitalized for
            a 5-day period on September 22 for "nervous exhaustion." 729 Marina has denied that she was hospitalized for a nervous disorder 730 and he made no mention
            of it in his diary or letters to his family; he probably lied to the Embassy. The
            Embassy replied to his letter on October 12, saying that it had no way of influencing
            Soviet conduct on such matters and that its experience had been that action on applications
            for exit visas was "seldom taken rapidly." 731
            
            In October 1961 Marina took her annual vacation. 732 She and Oswald agreed that she should get a "change of scenery," 733 and she spent about 3 weeks
            with an aunt in Khar'kov. It is possible that they were not getting along well together
            during this period. 734 A dairy entry after her return indicates that they were having
            some quarrels and that she was wavering in her decision to go to the United States,
            which Oswald attributed to anxiety about their applications for visas and the fact that she was
            pregnant; he in turn dreaded the approach of the "hard Russian winter." 735 He noted
            in his dairy that he was lonely while she was gone, but that he and his friend "Erich,"
            presumably Erik Titovyets, went to some dances and other public amusements.736 On
            his 22nd birthday he went alone to see his favorite opera, "The Queen of Spades."
            737 Marina sent him a gold and silver cup, inscribed "To my dear husband on his birthday, 18/x/61"
            and other gifts, for which he wrote to thank her.738 She returned on November 12,
            in Oswald's words, "radient, with several jars of preserses for me from her aunt." 739
            
            Sometime after Marina's return Oswald applied for an interview with Col. Nicolay Aksenov, an official in the local MVD,
            in an effort to expedite their application for exit visas; he was told by the colonel's
            subordinates that they were competent to handle the matter. Oswald then insisted that Marina seek an interview; she agreed reluctantly. The interview was granted; 740 Marina thought that this might have been due to the fact that her uncle was also a high-ranking
            official in the Minsk MVD, but she did not believe that he would personally have presumed
            on his official position to obtain special treatment.741 Colonel Aksenov questioned
            her about her reasons for wanting to go to the United States and, noticing that she
            was pregnant, suggested that she at least delay her departure so that her child could
            be born in Russia, but did not otherwise try to discourage her. He finally told her
            that there were many others seeking visas and that she and her husband would have
            to wait their turn.742
            
            Throughout this period, Oswald continued to correspond with his mother and brother. His letters contained the usual
            chatter among members of a family and occasional references to the progress of the
            visa applications.743 He wrote to the Embassy on November 1, saying that if, as he
            anticipated, his residence permit were renewed in January for another year, it would
            be over his protest. 744 On November 13 the Embassy replied, telling Oswald that retention of his Soviet passport, which was of the kind issued to persons considered
            to be stateless, or an extension of it, would not prejudice his claim to Ameri-
            
            Page 709
            
            can citizenship. The letter added that he could discuss the renewal of his American
            passport whenever he appeared in person at the Embassy to do so.745
            
            Late in December, Oswald wrote a letter to Senator John G. Tower of Texas, which was received in Washington
            near the end of January. He stated that he was an American citizen and that the Soviet
            Government refused to permit him and his wife to leave the Soviet Union. He asked
            Senator Tower to raise "the question of holding by the Soviet Union of a citizen of
            the U.S., against his will and expressed desires." The letter was referred to the
            State Department and no further action concerning it was taken.746 On December 25,
            Marina was called to the Soviet Passport Office and told that exit visas would be granted
            to her and her husband; she was surprised, having doubted that she would ever be permitted
            to leave. Oswald wrote to the Embassy on December 27 that they would be given visas and asked that
            his passport be extended without another trip to Moscow; he added, however, that he
            would come to Moscowif this would expedite the processing of his application. In his diary, he wrote,
            "It's great (I think?)." 747 Before the year ended, Marina went on maternity leave from her job.748 They spent New Year's Eve at a dinner party
            given by the Zigers.749
            
            Oswald wrote to his mother on January 2, 1962, and told her that he and his wife expected to arrive in the United States sometime
            around March. He asked her to contact the local Red Cross and request that it put
            his case before the International Rescue Committee or some other group which aids
            immigrants to the United States. He told her that he would need about $800 and that
            she should insist on a gift rather than a loan; he told her not to send any of her
            own money.750 Despite his instructions, she requested a loan from the Red Cross.751
            On January 13, Oswald wrote to the International Rescue Committee himself; he asked for $800 with which
            to purchase two tickets from Moscowto Texas.752 He wrote to the Committee again on January 26, this time asking for $1,000.753
            
            In the meantime, letters of Oswald 754 and the American Embassy,755 both dated January 5, crossed in the mail. The Embassy's
            letter suggested that since there might be difficulties in obtaining an American visa
            for Marina, he consider returning alone and bringing her over later. He replied on the 16th
            that he would not leave Russia without her.756 In his letter, Oswald requested that the U.S. Government loan him the money for his and Marina's airplane tickets or arrange a loan from another source. The Embassy replied on
            January 15 that Marina had not yet obtained an American visa and that no evidence had yet been submitted
            that she would not become a public charge in the United States.757 It suggested that
            Oswald's mother or some other close relative file an affidavit of support in Marina's behalf. Before receiving this letter, Oswald wrote out such a document himself 758 and mailed it to the Embassy.759
            
            On January 28, after receiving the Embassy's letter, he wrote that his own affidavit
            should be sufficient, since he had been away from
            
            Page 710
            
            the United States for more than 2 years and could not be expected to obtain an affidavit
            from someone else.760 But on the same day, he wrote to his mother asking that she
            file an affidavit of support with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.761 On
            January 24, the Embassy acknowledged receipt of his affidavit, but again suggested
            that he obtain one from someone else.762
            
            Late in January, Oswald received a letter from his mother telling him that he had been given a dishonorable
            discharge from the Marines.763 (The discharge had actually been "undesirable," a less
            derogatory characterization.) 764 This apparently revived his fear of prosecution,
            and on January 30, he wrote to his brother for more information.765 On the same day
            he wrote also to John B. Connally, Jr., then Governor of Texas, who Oswald believed was still Secretary of Navy. The letter read:
            
            I wish to call your attention to a case about which you may have personal knowlege
            since you are a resident of Ft. Worth as I am.
            
            In November 1959 an event was well publicated in the Ft. Worth newspapers concerning
            a person who had gone to the Soviet Union to reside for a short time, (much in the
            same way E. Hemingway resided in Paris.)
            
            This person in answers to questions put to him by reporteds in Moscowcriticized certain facets of american life. The story was blown up into another "turncoat"
            sensation, with the result that the Navy department gave this person a belated dishonourable
            discharge, although he had received an honourable discharge after three years service
            on Sept. 11, 1959 at El Toro, Marine corps base in California.
            
            These are the basic facts of my case.
            
            I have and allways had the full sanction of the U.S. Embassy, MoscowUSSR. and hence the U.S. government. In as much as I am returning to the U.S.A. in
            this year with the aid of the U.S. Embassy, bring with me my family (since I married
            in the USSR) I shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to
            a boni-fied U.S. citizen and ex--service man. The U.S. government has no charges or
            complaints against me. I ask you to look into this case. and take the neccessary steps
            to repair the damage done to me. and my family. For information I would direct you
            to consult the American Embassy, Chikovski St. 19/21, Moscow, USSR.766
            
            Connally referred the letter to the Department of the Navy,767 which sent Oswald a letter stating that the Department contemplated no change in the undesirable discharge.
            768 On March 22, Oswald wrote to the Department insisting that his discharge be given a further, full review.769
            The Department promptly replied that it had no authority to hear and review petitions
            of this sort and referred Oswald to the Navy Discharge Review Board.770 Oswald filled out
            
            Page 711
            
            the enclosed application for review in Minsk but did not mail it until he returned
            to the United States.771
            
            The Department of State had notified Oswald's mother that it would need $900 to make the travel arrangements for her son and
            daughter-in-law.772 On February 1, Oswald sent his mother a brief letter rejecting her suggestion that she try to raise money
            by telling the newspapers about his financial plight.773 Five days later, the Embassy
            Oswald wrote to his mother again on February 9, reminding her to file an affidavit of support
            and asking that she send him clippings from the Fort Worthnewspapers about his defection to Russia, a request which he later repeated to his
            brother. He told her that he wanted to know what had been written about him, so that
            he could be "forewarned."
            
            Oswald took Marina to the hospital on the morning of February 15. A baby girl was born at about 10 a.m.776
            He had gone on to the factory where news of the birth awaited him on his arrival.777
            In accordance with regular hospital practice,778 he did not see the baby until Marina left the hospital.779 He was excited by the child,780 who was named "June Lee" in accordance with the Russian custom and law that a child's second name must be
            the father's first name or a variation of it. He had wanted to name his child "June
            Marina," and protested the application of the law to her, since he had a United States passport.
            His diary contains the wry comment, "Po-Russki." 781 His coworkers at the factory
            gave the Oswalds "one summer blanket, 6 light diapers, 4 warm diapers, 2 chemises, 3 very good warm
            chemises, 4 very nice suits and two toys" for the baby.782 Marina came home on February 23.783
            
            There was less urgency about the departure for the United States after June Lee was born.784 Oswald wrote to his mother,785 and brother,786 that he would probably not arrive for several
            months. The Embassy received a letter on March 3, in which Oswald applied for a loan of $800; 787 the Embassy replied that it was authorized to loan
            him only $500.788 It had in the meantime decided that his own affidavit of support
            for Marina would be sufficient under the circumstances.789 On March 15, he received notification
            from the Immigration and Naturalization Service that Marina's application for a visa had been approved.790 By March 28, he had received an affidavit
            of support in Marina's behalf from his mother's employer, Byron K. Phillips, 791 which he filed although
            it was no longer necessary to do so.792 A few days before, Marina, still on maternity leave, had quit her job. 793 Discussions with the Embassy to
            complete financial and travel arrangements continued in April and May.794 In a letter
            to Robert on April 12, Oswald wrote that only "the American side" was holding up their departure, but added that
            the winter being over, he didn't "really ... want to leave until the beginning of
            fall, since the spring and summer ... [in Russia] are so nice." 795
            
            Page 712
            
            On May 10, the Embassy wrote that everything was in order and suggested that Oswald come to the Embassy with his family to sign the final papers.796 At his request,797
            he was discharged from the factory on about May 18.798 His work had apparently never
            been very good. Marina testified that he was rather lazy and resented having to take orders.799 This estimate
            is confirmed by a report of the plant director and personnel department chief, filed
            on December 11, 1961, which was apparently a routine assessment of his work. The report noted that he
            did not, "display the initiative for increasing his skill" in his job, that he was
            "over-sensitive ... to remarks from the foremen, and ... careless in his work"; Oswald took "no part in the social life of the shop" and kept "very much to himself." 800
            
            Oswald picked up his Soviet, exit visa on May 22; 801 at about this time, he also had an
            interview with an official of the MVD to obtain final clearance for his departure.
            802 He wrote to Robert that he and his family would leave for Moscowon the following day and depart for England 10 to 14 days later. He expected to cross
            the Atlantic by ship, probably docking in New Orleans. Returning to a point which
            he had made in an earlier letter to his mother, he commented that he knew from the
            newspaper clippings what Robert had said about him when he left for Russia; he thought that Robert had talked too much at that time, and asked that Robert say nothing to the newspapers now. 803
            
            The Oswalds arrived in Moscowby May 24 804 and on that date filled out various documents at the American Embassy;
            805 Marina was given her American visa.806 Final arrangements for their emigration were made
            with Soviet officials. 807 On June 1, Oswald signed a promissory note at the Embassy for a repatriation loan of $435.71.808 He
            and his family boarded a train for Holland,809 which passed through Minsk that night.810
            They crossed the Soviet frontier at Brest on June 2. Two days later, they departed
            from Holland on the SS Maasdam. 811 Onboard ship, the Oswalds stayed by themselves; Marina testified that she did not often go on deck because she was poorly dressed and Oswald was ashamed of her.812
            
            Probably while he was on board the Maasdam Oswald wrote some notes on ship stationery, which appear to be a summary of what he thought
            he had learned by living under both the capitalist and Communist systems. The notes
            reflect his unhappy and deepening feeling of disillusionment with both the Soviet
            Union and the United States. Oswald observed that although reform groups may oppose the government in power, they always
            declare that they are for their people and their country, and he asked what "would
            happen if somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly opposed not, only to the
            governments, but to the people, too the entire land and complete foundations" of his
            society. He condemned existing political groups and proposed the formation of a third
            choice between communism and capitalism. neither of which was acceptable to him. "I
            have lived," he said, under both systems I have sought the answers and although it
            would
            
            Page 713
            
            be very easy to dupe myself into believing one system is better than the other, I
            know they are not." In these notes, he acknowledged that his "Red Cross" subsidy had
            been paid by the Soviet Government rather than the international organization, and
            said, "I shall never sell myself intentionlly, or unintentionlly to anyone again."
            (Commission Exhibit No. 25, p. 273.) It was probably also onboard ship that Oswald wrote two sets of answers to questions which he anticipated about his decision to
            go to Russia. and later to return to the United States. Although the sets of answers
            are somewhat similar, but the tone of one is apologetic, while the other suggests
            that Oswald went to Russia to study the Soviet system, but remained a loyal American and owed
            no apologies.814
            
            The Maasdam landed at Hoboken, N.J., on June 13.815 The Oswalds were met by Spas T. Raikin, a representative of the Traveler's Aid Society, which
            had been contacted by the Department of State; Raikin had the impression that Oswald was trying to avoid meeting anyone. He told Raikin that he had only $63 and had no
            plans either for that night or for travel to Fort Worth, and accepted the society's
            help, according to Raikin, "with confidence and appreciation."816 They passed through
            the immigration office without incident,817 and Raikin helped them through customs.818
            
            The society referred the Oswalds to the New York City Department of Welfare, which helped them find a room at the
            Times Square Hotel.819 Oswald told both Raikin and representatives of the welfare department that he had been a
            marine stationed at the American Embassy in Moscow, had married a Russian girl, renounced
            his citizenship, and worked in Minsk; he soon found out, he said, that the Russian
            propaganda was inaccurate but had not been able to obtain an exit visa for his wife
            and child for more than 2 years. He said also that he had paid the travel expenses
            himself.820
            
            The welfare department called Robert Oswald's home in Fort Worth. His wife answered and said that they would help. She contacted
            her husband who sent $200 immediately.821 Oswald refused to accept the money and insisted that the department itself should pay the
            fare to Texas; he threatened that they would go as far as they could on $63 and rely
            on local authorities to get them the rest of the way. In the end he accepted the money.822
            On the afternoon of June 14, the Oswalds left New York by plane for Fort Worth.823
            
            Return to Top
            
            FORT WORTH, DALLAS, NEW ORLEANS
            
            Oswald had originally indicated that he and his family would stay with his mother in Vernon,
            Tex.824 His decision to stay with Robert Oswald in Fort Worthapparently had been prompted by his brother's invitation in a letter to him in Russia.825
            Oswald listed only his brother as a relative on an "Intake Interview" form which he prepared
            for the New York Department of Welfare.826
            
            Page 714
            
            Robert took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas airport, to meet Lee and Marina and their baby, June Lee.827 He testified that the most noticeable change in his brother's appearance was
            that he had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat thinner than he had
            been in 1959. Robert thought that his brother had picked up "something of an accent" but, except for these
            changes was "the same boy" whom he had known before.828 Lee commented on the absence
            of newspaper reporters and seemed to Robert to be disappointed that none had appeared.829 Later on, Lee was anxious to avoid
            publicity.830
            
            Robert drove the Oswalds to his home at 7313 Davenport Street.831 For a few days, Lee seemed tense,832 but
            the brothers got along well,833 and to Robert it was "more or less ... [as if Lee] had not been to Russia"; they were "just together
            again." 834 They did not discuss politics, according to Robert because of a "tacit agreement" between them.835 Lee indicated to his brother that
            he hoped to have his undesirable discharge from the Marines corrected.836 Robert and his wife "took to Marina and June," and enjoyed showing Marina "things that she had never seen before." 837 Marina rested and took care of her baby, and when she could, helped in the household.838
            She testified that, apart from a trip to the library, Lee spent about a week "merely
            talking." 839
            
            On June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth, Oswald went to the office of Mrs. Pauline Virginia Bates, a public stenographer whose name
            he had found in the telephone directory,840 and asked her to type a manuscript from
            the "scraps of paper," on which he had recorded his impressions of the Soviet Union.841
            Intrigued by his tale that he had just returned from the Soviet Union and had smuggled
            his notes out of that country, she agreed to type the notes for $1 per page or $2
            an hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate.842 On that day and the succeeding
            2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing for Oswald while he remained in her office helping her with the notes and translating portions
            of them which were in Russian.843 At the end of each session he collected his notes
            and as much of the manuscript as she had done and took them away with him.844 On June
            20, he gave Mrs. Bates $10 for the 10 completed pages; he told her that he had no
            more money and refused to accept her offer to postpone pay-merit or continue the work
            for nothing.845
            
            Oswald told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in Fort Worthwho wanted to help him publish his notes.846 On June 19,847 he had called Peter Gregory,
            a petroleum engineer who was born in Siberia and taught Russian at the Fort WorthPublic Library as a "civic enterprise." 848 He asked if Gregory could give him a letter
            testifying to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could obtain work
            as an interpreter or translator. Gregory suggested that Oswald come to his office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at random and asked Oswald to read from it. Oswald read well, and Gregory gave him the letter he wanted.849 Gregory and Oswald had lunch together and discussed Oswald's life in the Soviet Union,850 but, according to Gregory's testimony, nothing was
            said about publishing Oswald's
            
            Robert took his wife and children to Love Field, the Dallas
            airport, to meet Lee and Marina and their baby, "June Lee. He testified that the most noticeable change in his
            brother's appearance was that he had become rather bald; he seemed also to be somewhat
            thinner
            than he had been in 1959. Robert thought that his brother
            had picked up something of an accent but, except for these
            changes was the same boy whom he had known before. Lee commented on the absence of newspaper reporters and seemed
            to Robert to be disappointed that none had appeared. Later
            on, Lee was anxious to avoid publicity. Robert drove the
            Oswalds to his home at 7313 Davenport
            Street. For a few days, Lee seemed tense, but
            the brothers got along well, and to Robert it was more or less ... [as if Lee]
            had not been to Russia; they were just together again.
            They did not discuss politics, according to Robert because
            of a tacit agreement between them. Lee indicated to his brother that he hoped to have his
            undesirable discharge from the Marines corrected. Robert and
            his wife took to Marina and June, and enjoyed showing Marina things that she had
            never seen before. Marina rested and took care of her baby, and when she could, helped in
            the household. She testified that, apart from a trip to the library, Lee spent about a week "merely
            talking. On June 18, 4 days after he arrived in Fort Worth,
            Oswald went to the office of Mrs. Pauline Virginia
            Bates, a public stenographer whose name he had found in the telephone directory, and
            asked her to
            type a manuscript from the scraps of paper, on which he
            had recorded his impressions of the Soviet Union. Intrigued by his tale that he had
            just returned
            from the Soviet Union and had smuggled his notes out of that country, she agreed to
            type the notes
            for $1 per page or $2 an hour, 50 cents less than her usual hourly rate. On that day
            and the
            succeeding 2 days, Mrs. Bates spent 8 hours typing for Oswald while he remained in her office helping her with the notes and translating
            portions of them which were in Russian. At the end of each session he collected his
            notes and as
            much of the manuscript as she had done and took them away with him. On June
            20, he gave Mrs. Bates $10 for the 10 completed pages; he told her that he had no more
            money and refused to accept her offer to postpone pay-merit or continue the work for
            nothing.
            Oswald told Mrs. Bates that there was an engineer in Fort Worth who wanted to help
            him publish his
            notes. On June 19, he had called Peter Gregory, a petroleum engineer
            who was born in Siberia and taught Russian at the Fort Worth Public Library as a civic enterprise. He asked if Gregory could give him a letter
            testifying to his ability to read and speak Russian, so that he could obtain work
            as an interpreter
            or translator. Gregory suggested that Oswald come to his
            office, where Gregory opened a Russian book at random and asked Oswald to read from it. Oswald read well, and
            Gregory gave him the letter he wanted. Gregory and Oswald had lunch together and discussed Oswald's life in the Soviet Union, but, according to Gregory's testimony,
            nothing was said about publishing Oswald's
            manuscript. About a week later, Gregory and his son Paul, a college student, visited
            the Oswalds at Robert
            Oswald's home and arranged for Marina to give Paul lessons in Russian during the
            summer. On June 26, Oswald
            was interviewed by FBI agents in Fort Worth. One of the agents who interviewed him
            described him as
            tense and drawn up; he said that Oswald
            exhibited an arrogant attitude ... and [was] inclined to be just a
            little insolent.
            Oswald declined to say why he had gone to Russia, saying
            that he refused to relive the past. He said that he had
            not attempted to obtain Soviet citizenship, had not been approached by Soviet officials
            for
            information about his experiences in the Marines, and had not offered them such information.
            Marina's Soviet passport required her to notify the Soviet Embassy in Washington of
            her
            address in this country, and Oswald told the agents that
            he planned to contact the Embassy for this purpose within a few days. He promised
            to notify the FBI
            if he were contacted by Soviet agents under suspicious
            circumstances or otherwise.
            Oswald told his brother about the interview, saying that
            it had been just fine. Oswald and his family remained
            with Robert for about a month. While they were there his
            mother moved to Fort Worth from Crowell, Tex., and sometime in July they moved into
            her apartment
            at 1501 West Seventh Street. Mrs. Oswald testified that she had visited them at Robert's house in June and moved to Fort Worth because she
            thought that the house was too crowded and wanted to help them. Mrs. Oswald described the period when her son and his family lived with her as a very happy month; according to her testimony, she and her son and
            daughter-in-law got along well. She mentioned that she not only helped Marina keep
            house and care
            for the baby but also aided her son in his efforts to find employment. Marina testified,
            however,
            that Lee did not get along well with his mother and that
            he decided after several weeks that they should move to their own apartment. He did
            not file a
            change-of-address card at the post office when the family moved to West Seventh Street,
            as he did
            when they made their next move, so he may have contemplated from the beginning that
            they would stay
            with his mother for only a short while. Around the middle of August, the Oswalds moved to a one-bedroom furnished
            apartment at2703 Mercedes Street, for which they paid
            $59.50 in advance for 1 month's rent. In the third week in July, Oswald had obtained a job as a sheet metal worker with the
            Louv-R-Pak Division of the Leslie Welding Co., a manufacturer of louvers and ventilators,
            to which
            he had been referred by the Texas Employment Commission. On his application for employment,
            filled
            out several days before, he wrote falsely that he had experience as a sheet metal
            worker and
            machinist in the Marines and had been honorably discharged. He usually worked 8 or
            9 hours a day,
            for which he was paid $1.25 an hour. Marina testified that Oswald did not like his work, but he was regarded as a good employee and remained with
            the company until October, when he quit. On the job, he kept to himself and was considered
            uncommunicative. Mrs. Oswald visited her son and his
            family at their apartment and tried to help them get settled; she testified that she
            bought some
            clothes for Marina and a highchair for the baby but that Oswald told her that he did not want her to buy things for his wife
            that he himself could not buy. Finally, Oswald
            apparently decided that he did not want his mother to visit the apartment anymore
            and he became
            incensed when his wife permitted her to visit despite his instructions. After he moved
            to Dallas in
            October, Oswald did not see his mother or communicate
            with her in any way until she came to see him after the assassination. Witnesses have
            described the
            Mercedes Street apartment as decrepit and very poorly furnished; there
            was no telephone service. Acquaintances observed that Marina and the baby were poorly
            clothed, that
            the Oswalds had little food, and that at
            first there was not a bed for the baby. On August 16, the FBI again
            interviewed Oswald. This interview took place in the
            back seat of a car in front of his home and covered substantially the same material
            as the previous
            interview. Oswald again denied having made any deal with
            representatives of the Soviet Union. He protested his undesirable discharge from the
            Marines, and
            stated that his wife was registered at the Soviet Embassy. He still refused to discuss
            why he had
            gone to the Soviet Union, but he was less hostile than he had been during the previous
            interview.
            According to his wife, however, he was very upset by the interest the FBI showed in
            him. The Oswalds became acquainted with a growing number
            of people of the Russian-speaking community in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, who were
            tied together
            socially by a common origin, language, and religion. The group was not restricted
            to people from
            Russia but was composed primarily of people from Eastern European countries. The Oswalds' initial contact with this group
            was through Peter Gregory. Marina gave conversational Russian lessons to Paul Gregory
            2 days a week
            during August and early September, for which she was paid $35. Most of the lessons
            took place at
            the Mercedes Street apartment and Oswald was generally
            present. In addition, Paul Gregory occasionally took the Oswalds shopping; after they became friendly, he had a number of discussions with
            Oswald, some of them politically oriented. Sometime around August 25,
            Peter Gregory invited the Oswalds and several
            members of the Russian community to his house for dinner. One of the guests was George
            Bouhe, a
            Dallas accountant and a leader of the Russian community. He was very interested in
            meeting and
            conversing with Marina, because she had spent much of her life in Leningrad, which
            was his
            birthplace. Also present was Mrs. Anna Meller, the Russian- born wife of a Dallas
            department store
            employee. Near the end of August, the Oswalds
            met Declan Ford, a consulting geologist in the Dallas area, and his Russian-born wife
            at Mrs.
            Meller's home. The Oswalds were also
            introduced to Mrs. Elena Hall, who was born in Tehran, Iran, of Russian parentage.
            She worked in a
            dental laboratory and at this time was divorced from her former husband John Hall,
            whom she
            subsequently remarried. In order to obtain dental aid for Marina, George Bouhe had
            brought her to
            Mrs. Hall's house. In early September, the
            Oswalds met Alexander Kleinlerer, another member of the Russian group, who was then
            courting Mrs. Hall. Mrs. Max Clark was introduced to Marina during this period by
            George Bouhe and
            Anna Meller. Max Clark met the Oswalds at a
            later time. At about the same time, they were visited by George De Mohrenschildt,
            a petroleum
            engineer born in Russia. who had heard of them from one of the Russian-speaking group.
            Later on,
            the Oswalds met his wife, Jeanne, and his
            daughter and son-in-law, Gary and Alexandra Taylor. Most of the members of the Russian
            community
            were interested in the Oswalds not only
            because they needed help, but also because they could provide the latest information
            about what was
            happening in Russia. Some members of the group were at first apprehensive about them
            because the
            apparent ease with which they had left Russia seemed suspicious. Nevertheless, many
            of the group
            provided small amounts of money, groceries, clothing, and furniture for the Oswalds; George Bouhe, Anna Meller, and Elena
            Hall were the primary contributors, although others provided help in the form of transportation
            and
            groceries. These acquaintances occasionally visited the Oswalds, and the Oswalds in
            turn visited some of them in Dallas. It was evident that Oswald did not appreciate the help of the Russian community. At least once he flew into
            a rage and shouted that he did not need any of the things that people were giving
            to him. Some felt
            that he resented the gifts because he could not give his wife what the others were
            providing;903 he
            apparently was critical of them also because he felt that they were overly concerned
            with improving
            themselves economically. Oswald became increasingly unpopular with his Russian-speaking
            acquaintances, partly because of his resentment of their assistance. Alexander Kleinlerer
            stated
            that none of them cared for Oswald
            because of his political philosophy, his criticism of the United States, his
            apparent lack of interest in anyone but himself and because of his treatment of Marina.
            Some of them believed that Oswald was mentally
            disturbed. However, they felt sorry for Marina and the child and continued to help.
            On a weekend
            afternoon early in October, the Oswalds were
            visited by his mother and a number of people from the Russian community, including
            George Bouhe,
            Anna Meller, the Halls, the De Mohrenschildts, and the Taylors. Oswald had apparently decided to look for a new job, and discussed his lack of job
            prospects and the fact that his rent was overdue. He was advised to seek employment
            in the Dallas
            area. Elena Hall invited Marina to move into her house in Fort Worth until Oswald found a job in Dallas. She accepted the proposal, and
            Mrs. Hall moved Marina. her daughter June, and the
            Oswalds' few household goods in a pickup truck belonging to the dental laboratory
            where she
            was employed. Oswald worked at the Leslie Welding Co. on Monday, October
            8, but failed to appear on the following day. He was already in Dallas. He falsely
            told his
            wife that he had been discharged, and told George Bouhe that the job had been a temporary
            one.
            Sometime later, the company received an undated letter from him stating that he had
            moved permanently to Dallas, and asking that the wages due him be forwarded to
            him at box 2915 in Dallas. He did not tell his mother
            that he was leaving Fort Worth. While they were in Fort Worth, the Oswalds were having marital problems. Several
            people noted that Marina had a blackened eye when they visited her at the Mercedes
            Street
            apartment. She told her mother-in-law and George Bouhe that her husband had struck
            her, but said to
            Anna Meller that she had walked into a door. It seems clear that Oswald had in fact hit her. People observed friction between the Oswalds on various occasions, although their
            disputes became more apparent later. Marina has written that this was a difficult
            period for them
            and that her husband was very irritable and sometimes some completely
            trivial thing would drive him into a rage. She testified that: ...
            immediately after coming to the United States Lee
            changed. I did not know him as such a man in Russia. ... He helped me as before, but
            he became a
            little more of a recluse ... He was very irritable, sometimes for a trifle ... She
            has denied,
            however, that their separation was the result of quarrels between them. Marina spent
            the first few
            weeks after Oswald's departure at Elena Hall's
            house in Fort Worth, except for a brief stay at Gary Taylor's house in Dallas after
            one of her
            appointments at the Baylor Dental Clinic. While she was in Dallas, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt
            brought
            her to the clinic on October 8, October
            10, and October 15; George Bouhe had given Mrs. De
            Mohrenschildt the money to cover the expense of Marina's dental care. Even before
            Oswald went to Dallas, some of his acquaintances were helping
            him in his effort to find a job there. George De Mohrenschildt directed him to Samuel
            B. Ballen, a
            Dallas financial consultant, but no employment resulted. George Bouhe recommended
            that Oswald go to the Texas Employment Commission in Dallas; and
            Anna Meller had her husband ask Mrs. Helen Cunningham, a counselor in the clerical
            and sales
            division of the Dallas office of the employment commission, to help Oswald find a job. Oswald first came into the office of the employment commission on October 9. He was reluctant to accept industrial employment, and was placed in the
            clerical category and turned over to Mrs. Cunningham for counseling. He indicated
            that he had an
            interest in writing. The results of general aptitude tests which he had taken at the
            Fort Worth
            employment office had been transmitted to the Dallas office, and indicated that he
            had some
            aptitude in this direction and for clerical work. It was noted on his application
            form that he had
            outstanding verbal-clerical potential. He demonstrated ability to
            perform many skilled and semi-skilled jobs, and there was some indication that he
            could do college
            work. Mrs. Cunningham gave him three special tests: for general clerical work, work
            as an insurance
            claims examiner, and drafting work. He scored high on all three. His application form
            indicated
            that he did not have a driver's license, and noted: well-groomed and spoken,
            business suit, alert replies--expresses self extremely well. He told Mrs. Cunningham that
            he hoped to develop qualifications for responsible junior executive employment by
            a work-study
            program at a local college but that this must be delayed because of his immediate
            financial needs
            and responsibilities. Mrs. Cunningham concluded that although Oswald would be classified for clerical work, she should try to get him any available
            job, since he badly needed money. He was referred to an architect for an opening as
            a messenger but
            was not hired. On October 11, he was referred to
            Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall Co., a graphic arts company, in response to a call from John
            Graef, head of
            the photographic department of the company, who had told the employment commission
            that he needed a
            photoprint trainee. Oswald was enthusiastic about his
            prospects and apparently made a good impression; Graef picked him over several other
            applicants. On
            the following day he began working in his new position as a trainee making prints
            of advertising
            material. He worked a 40-hour week at approximately $1.35 per hour; his take-home
            pay varied from
            $49 to $74 a week. According to his wife, he liked his work very much.
            Oswald moved into the YMCA on October 15, and stayed there until
            October 19, paying $2.25 a night. He had used the Taylors'
            address and telephone number as a place where he could be reached, but on October 9 had also rented post office box 2915 under his
            own name at the main post office on Ervay Street. On October 10, he
            filed a change-of-address form indicating that mail for 2703
            Mercedes Street should be forwarded to the box. Marina has written that Oswald wrote her letters and telephoned her during the
            separation. On October 16, Mrs Hall brought Marina and June to Dallas to have June baptized. Marina apparently did this surreptitiously, because her husband opposed
            baptism; they did not contact him in Dallas, but left birthday gifts for him at the
            Taylors.
            Oswald did not appear very disturbed when he found out
            about the baptism. Two days later, Mrs. Hall had an automobile accident and went to
            the hospital,
            where she remained until October 26; Marina remained in the Hall
            house. Mrs. Max Clark and Alexander Kleinlerer, a friend of Mrs. Hall, checked up
            to make sure that
            she was getting along without too much trouble. After Oswald left the YMCA on October 19, he moved to a room or
            apartment somewhere in Dallas, which has not been located. It seems likely, however,
            that during
            that time he spent several weekends with Marina at the Hall house. Four days after
            Mrs. Hall
            returned from the hospital, she left for New York to visit friends. By the time she
            returned,
            Marina had moved to a three-room apartment at 604
            Elsbeth Street in Dallas, which Oswald had
            rented on Saturday, November 3; the landlady stated that he had
            looked at the apartment about a week before. The monthly rent was $68, in addition
            to which he had
            to pay several dollars a month for utilities. He paid the rent plus a $5 deposit on
            November 3, but probably spent that night with Marina at the Hall house.
            On Sunday the Taylors helped the Oswalds move
            their belongings to the Elsbeth Street apartment with a rented trailer. Oswald had asked Kleinlerer to help them move, and Kleinlerer
            also was present when they departed. Soon after the
            Oswalds were reunited, their marital difficulties started again. While they were moving
            to Elsbeth Street, Kleinlerer noticed that Oswald
            slapped his wife for not having the zipper on her dress completely closed. They argued
            over his
            refusal to allow her to smoke. There was a quarrel also when he told the landlady
            that Marina was
            from Czechoslovakia; he was angered when Marina, who disapproved of this deception,
            told the
            landlady the truth. Although several people tried to help Marina improve her scanty
            knowledge of
            English, Oswald discouraged this, perhaps because he
            wanted to keep up his Russian. Some witnesses testified that she commented about his
            sexual
            abilities. He apparently continued to beat her, and once she suggested to George De
            Mohrenschildt
            that she should get away from Oswald. When De Mohrenschildt criticized Oswald's conduct, Oswald replied, It is my business. Marina testified that when they moved into the Elsbeth
            Street apartment, her husband became nervous and irritable and was very
            angry over trifles. She said that it was sometimes her fault that he beat
            her, for example when she wrote to an old boyfriend in Russia that she wished she
            had married him;
            the letter was returned for postage due, and Oswald read
            it. Because of this quarreling, a few of their acquaintances felt that Marina would
            be better off
            alone. George Bouhe offered to help her if she promised to leave Oswald permanently. Finally, in early November, Marina, helped by the De Mohrenschildts,
            moved into Anna Meller's house with the intention not to return to Oswald. He was apparently quite upset and did not want Marina
            to leave him. Oswald did not visit his wife at Anna Meller's house, and for a short
            time did
            not even know where she was. According to Marina, he called her after she moved and
            they met at De
            Mohrenschildt's house. He asked her to return home. She insisted that he stop quarreling
            and
            that he change his ways. He said that he could not change. Marina would not agree
            to return home
            with him and he left. Marina was uncomfortable at the Meller house, where there was
            very little
            room. She moved to Katherine Ford's house where she apparently stayed from November 11 to 17. She indicated that she had decided never to
            return to her husband; it was Mrs. Ford's impression that Marina was going to stay
            at other
            people's houses until a permanent place could be found for her. When Mr. Ford returned
            from a
            business trip on November 17, Marina and June moved to the home of Mrs. Frank Ray, where they spent the
            day. Mrs. Ray, the wife of a Dallas advertising man, was also of Russian origin. Since
            Mrs. Ray had
            no baby bed, Marina returned to the Fords that evening. On the next day, however,
            Marina moved her
            belongings to the Rays' house. That same day, Oswald called and asked to visit his wife, whom he had called and written. Mr. Ray
            picked him up and took him to Marina. Marina testified that at this meeting Oswald professed his love for her. She stated: I saw him cry ... [he] begged me to come back, asked my forgiveness, and promised
            that
            he would try to improve, if only I would come back. On another occasion she said: ... he cried and you know a woman's heart--I went back to him. He said he
            didn't care to live if I did not return? That same day she decided to return to him.
            Mr. Ray packed her belongings and took her back to the Elsbeth Street apartment. Members
            of the
            Russian community who had taken care of Marina so that she would not have to live
            with Oswald felt that their efforts had been in vain. George Bouhe
            was so irritated that he never again tried to help either of the Oswalds. Contacts between them and members of
            the Russian community diminished markedly. Oswald did
            not care for most of these people and made his feelings apparent. Even the De Mohrenschildts,
            whom
            he liked most, saw much less of them. Lydia Dymitruk, another Russian born woman in
            the Dallas-Fort
            Worth area, testified that she saw the
            Oswalds on only one occasion, and did not care to see them again. She drove Marina and
            June, who had a high fever, to the hospital; Oswald told the hospital that he was unemployed in order to
            avoid paying for June's treatment and later left Mrs.
            Dymitruk without thanking her. Mrs. Ford testified that Marina had told her that she
            contemplated
            suicide during this period because Oswald was treating
            her badly and she had no friends; she felt that she had no way out.
            Marina acknowledged to the Commission that she had such thoughts. In an effort to
            renew family
            ties, Robert Oswald wrote to Lee and John Pic on November
            17, inviting them and their families to Thanksgiving dinner. Lee accepted the invitation. He and Marina traveled to Fort
            Worth by bus on Thanksgiving Day, and John Pic and Robert
            met them at the station. Pic had not seen his half-brother for 10 years. He observed,
            as many
            others have also attested, that Lee seemed to be a good
            father and to take an active interest in June. After
            dinner, Marina phoned Paul Gregory, who later drove the Oswalds to his house for sandwiches and then took them to the bus station for the
            return trip to Dallas. Thereafter, Robert spoke to his
            brother once by telephone and received a post card and a letter from him, but he eventually
            lost
            contact with Lee and did not see him again until after
            the assassination. Despite his disillusionment with Soviet life, Oswald kept up his interest in Russia. He wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington for
            information on how to subscribe to Russian periodicals and for any periodicals or
            bulletins which you may put out for the benefit of your citizens living, for a time,
            in the
            U.S.A. He subsequently subscribed to several Russian journals. In December 1962, the Soviet Embassy received a card in Russian, signed
            Marina and Lee Oswald, which
            conveyed New Year's greetings and wishes for health, success and all of the
            best to the employees at the Embassy. The
            Oswalds continued to correspond with acquaintances in Russia. Soon after his return to
            this country, Oswald had started to correspond with the
            Communist Party, U.S.A., and the Socialist Workers
            Party. He subscribed to the Worker in August 1962. He wrote for
            additional literature from these organizations, and attempted to join the Socialist
            Workers Party,
            which, however, had no branch in Texas. He sent samples of his photographic work to
            the Socialist
            Workers Party, the Worker, and the Hall-Davis Defense Committee, and offered to aid
            them in
            printing and photographic work in connection with posters; these offers were not accepted.
            He
            continued to read a great deal on a variety of subjects. George Bouhe testified that
            Oswald's fare consisted of books by Marx, Lenin, and similar things. Marina said that he read books of a historical nature,
            including H. G. Wells' two volume Outline of History, and
            biographies of Hitler, Kennedy, and Khrushchev. Despite the Oswalds' break with the Russian community,
            De Mohrenschildt, knowing that they would be alone during the Christmas season, asked
            the Fords
            whether he could bring the Oswalds to a party
            celebrating the Russian Christmas at the Fords' home; the Fords assented. The party
            was
            attended by many members of the Russian community. Oswald spoke at length with Yaeko Okui, a Japanese woman who had been brought to the
            party by Lev Aronson, first cellist of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra; she told Federal
            investigators that she never saw Oswald again. The Oswalds were not invited to three other Russian
            Christmas season gatherings which occurred during the next few days. Marina visited
            the De
            Mohrenschildts several times after Christmas. They invited both Lee and Marina to a small dinner party in February 1963; also present were Everett
            Glover, a chemist employed in Dallas, and his roommate Volkmar Schmidt. On February
            22, Glover had
            a gathering at his house, one of the purposes of which was to permit his friends,
            many of whom were
            studying Russian, to meet the Oswalds. They
            were the objects of much attention. Marina conversed at length with another guest
            named Ruth Paine,
            who had recently separated from her husband, Michael Paine, a research engineer at
            the Bell
            Helicopter plant in Fort Worth. Mrs. Paine, who was studying Russian, obtained Marina's
            address and shortly thereafter wrote Marina asking to see her. Marina responded by
            inviting Mrs.
            Paine to visit her. The Oswalds moved out of
            their Elsbeth Street apartment on March 3, 1963, to an upstairs
            apartment several blocks away at 214 West Neely
            Street. Oswald inquired about the apartment in
            response to a For Rent sign; the rent was $60 per month, not including
            utilities. They moved without assistance, carrying their belongings in their hands
            and in a baby
            stroller. Marina preferred the Neely Street apartment because it had a porch and was,
            she felt,
            more suitable for June. Aware of Oswald's difficulties in obtaining employment, George
            Bouhe had advised him as early as October/1962 to attend a night school
            in Dallas. On January 14, Oswald enrolled in a typing course in the night school of Crozier Technical High School,
            and started attending on January 28. The class ran from 6:15 to 7:15
            p.m. on Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays. Although Oswald
            reviewed a typing textbook at home, he attended the course irregularly and stopped
            going altogether
            on about March 28. Ruth Paine and Marina started to exchange visits in
            March. Mrs. Paine invited the Oswalds for
            dinner, and on April 20 she took them on a picnic. When Oswald was not present, the two women frequently discussed
            their respective marital problems, and Marina disclosed to Mrs. Paine that she was
            pregnant. Marina
            wrote of these meetings: One day we were invited to a friend's house, where I met
            Ruth Paine,
            who was studying Russian here in America and wanted to improve her conversational
            knowledge. We
            began to see each other. Ruth would come to see me with her children. This was very
            good for both
            me and for June. She was growing up alone and becoming
            terribly wild, so the company of other children was good for her. Sometimes we went
            out on picnics
            at a nearby lake. Lee loved to fish, and we would look
            and rejoice if he caught a little fish. Several times we went to visit Ruth who lived
            in Irving.
            Using the name of A. J. Hidell, Oswald had ordered
            a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 revolver from Los Angeles on a form which he dated January 27. On March 12, he ordered a rifle from Klein's
            Sporting Goods in Chicago under the name of A. Hidell.
            Oswald used the name Alek James Hidell on identification cards
            which he probably produced at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall. One of his fellow employees
            taught him
            various photographic techniques, which he could have used to prepare not only these
            cards, but also
            the samples of his work which he sent to various organizations. Both weapons were
            shipped on March 20. Oswald kept the rifle
            in a small storeroom at the Neely Street apartment. He spent long periods of time
            in the storeroom,
            which he told Marina she was not to enter. He told her that he intended to use the
            rifle for hunt-
            ing and that he practiced with it. She saw him leave with it once, and clean it several
            times. He
            also posed for two pictures, taken by Marina in the backyard of the Neely apartment,
            in which he
            held his rifle and copies of the Worker and the Militant and the revolver was strapped
            to his belt.
            He gave one of the pictures to his wife and asked her to keep it for June. Over the weekend of March
            9-10, Oswald photographed the alley which runs
            behind the home of Gen. Edwin Walker, and probably at about the same time he photographed
            the rear
            of Walker's home and a nearby railroad track and right-of-way. He prepared and studied
            a
            notebook in which he outlined a plan to shoot General Walker, and he looked at bus
            schedules. He
            went to the Walker residence on the evening of April 6 or 7, planning
            to make his attack. However, he changed his plans, hid his rifle nearby, and determined
            to act on
            the following Wednesday, April 10, when a nearby church was planning a
            meeting which, Oswald reasoned, would create a diversion
            that would help him escape. On Wednesday, Oswald left a
            note for Marina telling her what to do if he were apprehended. He retrieved his rifle
            and fired at
            Walker, but the bullet narrowly missed Walker's head. Oswald secreted his rifle again and took the bus home. When Oswald told Marina what he had done, she became angry and made
            him promise never to repeat such an act. She testified that she kept his letter, intending
            to give
            it to the authorities if he repeated his attempt. He told Marina that he was sorry
            he had missed
            Walker and said that the shooting of Walker would have been analogous to an assassination
            of
            Hitler. Several days later, the De Mohrenschildts visited the Oswalds, bringing an Easter present for June. During the visit, Jeanne De Mohrenschildt saw the rifle and
            told her husband about it. Without any knowledge of the truth, De Mohrenschildt jokingly
            intimated
            that Oswald was the one who had shot at Walker. Oswald apparently concluded that Marina had told De
            Mohrenschildt of his role in the attempt and was visibly shaken. On April
            6, Oswald was dropped by Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall
            because, in his supervisor's opinion, he could not do the work, although he was trying;
            in
            addition, he did not get along with his fellow employees. The fact that he brought
            a Russian
            newspaper to work may also have been of some significance. Marina testified that her
            husband, who
            had always worried about his job security at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall, was quite upset
            by the loss of
            his job since he had liked the work. Oswald again resorted to the Texas Employment
            Commission. On
            April 8, he informed the Commission that he was seeking employment but
            was referred to no employers. He stated that he had been laid off at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall
            due to
            lack of work." On April 12, he made a claim for unemployment benefits;
            4 days later the commission mailed him a determination disapproving his claim because
            of
            insufficient wage credits. For a while after the
            Oswalds moved into the Neely Street apartment they got along well, but they soon began to
            quarrel. Oswald was apparently still preventing Marina from learning English, and
            there is some
            indication that he continued to beat her. Since February, he had been urging her to
            return to
            Russia. Marina wrote several letters to the Russian Embassy requesting a visa to return
            to Russia.;
            she testified, however, that Oswald forced her to write
            them, and that she never wanted to return to Russia. When Ruth Paine visited the Oswalds at their apartment on April 24, she was surprised to learn that Oswald was packed and ready to leave for New Orleans by bus. He explained that he had
            been unable to find employment in or around Dallas, and that Marina had suggested
            that he go to New
            Orleans since he had been born there. Marina has testified that the real reason behind
            her
            suggestion was that she wanted to get him out of town because of the Walker incident.
            Mrs. Paine
            offered to drive Marina to New Orleans at a later date, and also to have Marina and
            June stay with her rather than at the apartment in the meantime.
            Oswald helped the women pack Mrs. Paine's car, and
            the two women moved everything from the Neely Street apartment to the Paine house
            in Irving. When
            he arrived at the bus station in New Orleans, Oswald
            telephoned his aunt, Lillian Murret, to ask if he could stay at her home at 757 French Street while he looked for employment. She had been
            unaware that he had returned from Russia or that he was married and had a child and
            was surprised
            to hear from him. She said that she did not have room to accommodate three guests,
            but that since
            he was alone he was welcome. Oswald had been born in New Orleans, and on his return
            showed great
            interest in finding out what had happened to the other members of his father's family.
            He
            visited the cemetery where his father was buried and called all the Oswalds in the telephone book. By this method he
            located one relative, Mrs. Hazel Oswald of Metairie, La., the
            widow of William Stout Oswald, his father's
            brother. He visited her at her home; she gave him a picture of his father and told
            him that as far
            as she knew the rest of the family was dead. On April 26, Oswald began his search for employment. He went to the
            employment office of the Louisiana Department of Labor and stated that he was qualified
            as a
            commercial photographer, shipping clerk, or darkroom man. The interviewer
            noted on Oswald's application card: Will travel on limited basis. Will relocate. Min. $1.25 hr. Neat. Suit. Tie.
            Polite. Although the employment commission made a few referrals, Oswald relied primarily upon newspaper advertisements, and
            applied for a number of positions. Mrs. Murret testified that he would spend the day
            job hunting,
            return to her home for supper, watch television, and go to bed. On April
            29, he filed a request for reconsideration of the employment commission's disapproval
            of his unemployment compensation claim. His complaint that he had not been credited
            for his
            employment at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall was ruled valid on May 8, and he was
            granted maximum benefits of $369, payable at the rate of $33 per week. He filed interstate
            claims
            on May 7 and 15, and received $33 in response to the latter; the former
            claim was filed before the expiration of the prescribed wailing period. Not only had
            Oswald in fact been working since May
            10, but he included on his claim sheet, as concerns with which he had sought work,
            fictitious employers and employers whom he apparently had not contacted. Oswald wrote
            to Marina:
            All is well. I am living with Aunt Lillian. She has very kindly taken us in. I
            am now looking for work. When I find it I will write you. And on May
            3, he wrote to Marina and Ruth Paine: Girls, I still have not found work,
            but I receive money from the unemployment office in the amount 15 to 20 dollars. They
            were
            mistaken in the Dallas office when they refused, but I straightened everything out.
            Uncle
            'Dyuz' offered me a loan of $200.00 if needed. Great, eh?! On May 9, responding to a newspaper advertisement, Oswald completed an application for employment with William B. Reily Co., Inc., at
            640 Magazine Street, an enterprise engaged in the
            roasting, grinding, canning, bagging, and sale of coffee. On his application form,
            Oswald listed as references in addition to John Murret, Sgt. Robert Hidell and Lieut. J. Evans, both apparently
            fictitious names. His application was approved and he began work on May
            10, at the rate of $1.50 per hour. His task was the lubrication of the company's
            machinery. Oswald did not enjoy this work, and told his
            wife and Mrs. Paine that he was working in commercial photography. Also on May
            9, Oswald obtained an apartment at 4905 Magazine Street with the help of Myrtle Evans, who had
            known him when he was a child. The rent was $65 a month. Oswald moved in on May 10, after telephoning Marina on the
            ninth and asking her to come to New Orleans. Ruth Paine testified that the invitation
            elated
            Marina: Papa nas lubet--"Daddy loves us," she repeated again and again.
            Mrs. Paine drove Marina and June to New Orleans; they left
            Dallas on May 10, spent the night in Shreveport, and arrived on the
            11th. Mrs. Paine stayed with the Oswalds for
            8 days; the three of them, with June and Mrs. Paine's
            children, toured the French Quarter. On May 14, Mrs. Paine left New
            Orleans to return to her home. The Murrets and the
            Oswalds exchanged visits from time to time; Marina testified that the Murrets were very
            good to them. Mrs. Murret's daughter, Marilyn, took the Oswalds on an outing. But, according to
            Marina's testimony, aside from Ruth Paine and Ruth Kloepfer and her daughters, the
            Murrets
            were the only social visitors the Oswalds
            had. Ruth Kloepfer was a clerk of the Quaker Meeting in New Orleans whom Ruth Paine
            had written in
            the hope that she might know some Russian-speaking people who could visit Marina.
            Mrs. Kloepfer
            herself visited the Oswalds but made no
            attempt to direct any Russian-speaking people to them. On July 19,
            Oswald was dismissed by Reily because of inefficiency
            and inattention to his work. He had spent many of his working hours next door at the
            Crescent City
            Garage, where he read gun magazines and discussed guns with one of the owners, Adrian
            Alba. On the
            following Monday, July 22, Oswald again visited the Louisiana employment office to seek new employment and file a
            claim for unemployment compensation. Thereafter, he collected unemployment compensation
            weekly and,
            although apparently making some effort to obtain another job, again listed a number
            of fictitious
            job applications on his unemployment compensation claim forms. He soon gave up his
            search for
            employment, and began to spend his days at home reading. He received another setback
            on July 25, when he was notified that in response to the request for review
            which he had made in 1962, his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps had been
            affirmed.
            During this period, Oswald began to evidence thoughts of
            returning to the Soviet Union or going to Cuba. On June 24 he applied
            for a new passport, which he received on the following day. Apparently at Oswald's request, Marina wrote to the Russian Embassy,
            expressing a desire to return to Russia and indicating that she would be accompanied
            by her
            husband. She explained that she wanted to return because of family problems, including
            the
            impending birth of her second child. Accompanying her letter was a letter written
            by Oswald dated July 1, in which he
            asked the Embassy to rush an entrance visa for his wife and requested that his visa
            be considered
            separately. Marina believed that Oswald was really
            planning to go only to Cuba. She testified that his basic desire was to get to
            Cuba by any means, and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that purpose.
            During the early days of the New Orleans period, the
            Oswalds' marriage was more harmonious than it had been previously. Marina wrote: ...
            our family life in New Orleans was more peaceful. Lee
            took great satisfaction in showing me the city where he was born. We often went to
            the beach, the
            zoo, and the park. Lee liked to go and hunt crabs. It is
            true, that he was not very pleased with his job ... We did not have very much money,
            and the birth
            of a new child involved new expenses ... As before, Lee
            spent a great deal of time reading. Marina testified, however, that after they had
            been in New
            Orleans for a while, Oswald became depressed and that
            she once found him alone in the dark crying. She wrote to Ruth Paine that his love had ceased soon after Mrs. Paine had left New Orleans. Mrs. Paine testified,
            however, that she had noticed friction between the
            Oswalds before she left. On July 11, Mrs. Paine wrote Marina
            that if Oswald did not wish to live with her any more
            and preferred that she return to the Soviet Union, she could live at the Paines' house.
            Although Mrs. Paine had long entertained this idea, this was the first time she explicitly
            made the
            invitation. She renewed the invitation on July 12, and again on July 14; she attempted to overcome any feeling which Marina might have that
            she would be a burden by stating that Marina could help with the housework and help
            her learn
            Russian, and that she would also provide a tax advantage. Marina replied that she
            had previously
            raised the subject of a separation and that it had led to arguments. She stated that
            she was happy
            and that for a considerable period of time Oswald had
            been good to her. She attributed this improved attitude to the fact that he was anticipating
            their
            second child. Marina turned down Mrs. Paine's invitation but said that she would take
            advantage of it if things became worse. Mrs. Paine replied that she was taking a trip
            north to
            visit her parents and would visit Marina in New Orleans about September
            18. She also suggested that Marina come to her house for the birth of the baby. On July 6, Eugene Murret, a cousin of Oswald who was studying to be a Jesuit Priest in Mobile, Ala., wrote and asked if
            Oswald could come to Mobile and speak at the Jesuit
            House of Studies about contemporary Russia and the practice of Communism
            there.
            Oswald accepted, and on July
            27 he and his family, joined by some of the Murrets, traveled to Mobile; Charles Murret
            paid the expenses. Oswald spoke concerning his
            observations in Russia and conducted a question and answer period; he impressed his
            listeners as
            articulate. He indicated that he had become disillusioned during his stay in Russia,
            and that in
            his opinion the best political system would be one which combined the best points
            of capitalism and
            communism. While he left his listeners with the impression that he was an atheist,
            he avoided a
            direct discussion of religion. The group returned to New Orleans on July
            28. In late May and early June, Oswald had
            apparently begun to formulate plans for creating a New Orleans branch of the Fair
            Play for Cuba
            Committee. Using the name Lee Osborne he ordered a number of printed
            circulars demanding Hands off Cuba in large letters, and application
            forms and membership cards for the proposed chapter. On August 5, he
            visited a store managed by Carlos Bringuier, a Cuban refugee and avid opponent of
            Castro and the
            New Orleans delegate of the Cuban student directorate. Oswald indicated an interest in joining the struggle against Castro. He told Bringuier
            that he had been a marine and was trained in guerrilla warfare, and that he was willing
            not only to
            train Cubans to fight Castro but also to join the fight himself. The next day Oswald returned to the store and left his Guidebook for Marines for Bringuier. On August 9, Bringuier
            saw Oswald passing out Fair Play for Cuba leaflets.
            Bringuier and his companions became angry and a dispute resulted. Oswald and the three Cuban exiles were arrested for disturbing the peace. Oswald spent the night in jail and was interviewed the next day
            by a lieutenant of the New Orleans Police Department. At Oswald's request, an FBI agent also interviewed him. Oswald maintained that he was a member of the New Orleans
            branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee which, he claimed, had 35 members. He stated
            also that
            he had been in touch with the president of that organization, A. J. Hidell. Oswald was in fact the only member of the
            New Orleans branch, which had never been chartered by the National Fair
            Play for Cuba Committee. Later that day Oswald was
            released on bail, and 2 days later he pleaded guilty to the charges against him and
            paid a $10
            fine. The charges against the Cuban exiles were dismissed. Marina testified that the
            arrest upset
            Lee and that he became less active,
            he cooled off a little after it. On August 16, Oswald,
            assisted by at least one other person who was a hired helper, again passed out Fair
            Play for Cuba
            literature, this time in front of the International Trade Mart. That night, television
            newscasts
            ran pictures of Oswald's activities. (This hindered
            Oswald's subsequent attempts to obtain employment
            in New Orleans.) Bringuier sent one of his friends to Oswald's home to pose as a Castro sympathizer and attempt to obtain information
            about Oswald, but Oswald apparently saw through the
            ruse. William Stuckey, a radio broadcaster with a program called Latin Listening
            Post, had long been looking for a member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee to appear
            on
            his program. He learned about Oswald from Bringuier, and
            visited Oswald on August
            17. Later that day, Stuckey recorded an interview with Oswald which was cut to about 5 minutes and played back on the show that evening. Two
            days later, Stuckey asked the news director of the station if he could run the entire
            tape, but the
            director felt that a debate with a local opponent of Castro would be of greater public
            interest.
            Consequently, Stuckey arranged for a debate between Oswald and Bringuier on a 25-minute daily public affairs program called Conversation Carte Blanche, which took place on August
            21. Oswald defended the Castro regime and
            discussed Marxism. He was put on the defensive when his defection to Russia was brought
            up, and
            Stuckey later testified that he thought that the program had finished the Fair Play
            for Cuba
            Committee in New Orleans. However, Stuckey also testified that Oswald seemed to be a clean-cut and intelligent person who conducted himself very well
            during the interviews and debates. Oswald wrote several times to V. T.
            Lee, then national director of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, telling him, sometimes
            in exaggerated terms, of his activities. He wrote also to the Communist Party and
            asked whether, in
            view of his prior defection, he should continue to fight, handicapped as it were,
            by ... [his] past record, [and] compete with anti-progressive forces, above-ground
            or ... should
            always remain in the background, i.e., underground. The Party replied that often it is advisable for some people to remain in the background, not
            underground. And although Oswald wrote four
            letters to V. T. Lee during the summer, there is no evidence that
            Oswald heard from him after May
            29. Ruth Paine arrived in New Orleans on September 20, and
            spent three nights with the Oswalds. During
            this stay, Mrs. Paine found relations between them much improved. Nonetheless, it
            was decided that
            Marina would go back with her to Irving for the birth of the baby. Marina and Mrs.
            Paine toured
            Bourbon Street while Oswald stayed home and did some
            packing for Marina's return to Texas. On Sunday, September
            22, Oswald and Mrs. Paine finished loading the
            station wagon with the Oswalds'
            household belongings. Return to Top MEXICO CITY
            Marina Oswald testified that sometime in August her husband
            first told her of his plan to go to Mexico and from there to Cuba, where he planned
            to stay; he had
            given up a plan to hijack an airplane and fly directly to Cuba, which plan Marina
            consistently
            opposed. On September 17, he obtained from the Mexican consulate
            general in New Orleans a Tourist Card, FM-8 No. 24085, good for one
            journey into Mexico for no longer than 15 days. Typed in the blank, Appelidos y
            nombre was Lee, Harvey Oswald,
            Fotogrofo; the intended destination was shown as Mexico City. (The comma
            between Lee and Harvey seems to have been an
            error.)1101 On the application Oswald stated that he was
            employed at 640 Rampart; he was in fact unemployed. (See
            Commission Exhibits Nos. 2478, 2481, p. 300.) Marina and June departed with Mrs. Ruth Paine for Irving on the morning of September 23. Before she left, Oswald told Marina that she should not tell anyone about his impending trip to Mexico.
            Marina kept this secret until after the assassination. On the previous day, Oswald's landlord had seen Mrs. Paine's car being
            packed and had asked Oswald whose rent was about 15 days
            overdue, whether he was leaving. Oswald told him that
            Marina was leaving temporarily but that he would remain. A neighbor testified that
            on the evening
            of September 24, he saw Oswald, carrying two pieces of luggage,
            hurriedly leave the Magazine Street apartment and board a bus. Though uncertain of
            the exact date,
            a city busdriver recalls that at the same time of day and at the same location he
            picked up a man
            who was carrying two suitcases of different sizes and helped him place them so that
            they would not
            disturb the other passengers. The driver remembers that the man asked directions to
            the Greyhound
            bus station. He discharged the passenger at an intersection where he could board a
            Canal Street car
            and transfer to another bus which would go past the Greyhound and Continental Trailways
            stations.
            The landlord found Oswald's apartment vacant on
            September 25. Oswald appears to have taken with him a
            Spanish-English dictionary; his address book; his 1963 passport and old
            passport; his correspondence with the Communist Party and with the Soviet Embassy
            in Washington,
            some of which was in Russian; proof of his marriage; newspaper clippings concerning
            his arrest and
            his interest in the activities of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (activities which,
            Marina
            testified, he had undertaken because he thought that they would help him when he got
            to Cuba);
            evidence that he was the Director of the New Orleans chapter of the
            Committee; and various other cards, such as a work card, which he had obtained in
            Russia. He took
            also several sheets of notepaper on which he had written a summary of important events
            in his life
            which he presumably intended to call to the attention of Cuban and Soviet officials
            in Mexico City
            to convince them to let him enter Cuba. On these sheets he had recorded facts about
            his Marine
            service, including the dates of his enlistment and discharge, the places where he
            had served, and
            the diplomas that he had received from military school. Recorded also were notes on
            his stay in the
            Soviet Union, his early interest in Communist literature, his ability to speak Russian,
            his
            organization of the New Orleans chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, his contact
            with
            police authorities in connection with his work for the Committee, and his experience
            in street agitation, as a radio speaker and lecturer,
            and as a photographer. The two pieces of luggage which Oswald took with him were a small, blue, zipper bag and a large, olive-colored bag, both
            made of cloth. He carried the smaller bag with him throughout the trip, but, at least
            from Nuevo
            Laredo to Mexico City, checked the larger one through to his destination. Oswald remained
            in New
            Orleans until September 25. His precise whereabouts on the night
            of September 24 are uncertain, but in view of his limited
            finances, he probably returned to the apartment to sleep after checking his luggage
            at a bus
            station or spent the night at an inexpensive hotel or roominghouse. Some time after
            5 a. m. on
            September 25, he collected a Texas unemployment compensation
            check for $33 at his New Orleans post office box. He cashed the check between 8 a.m.
            and noon at a
            store about six blocks from his apartment on Magazine Street. This gave him about
            $200 for the trip
            to Mexico. He left New Orleans by bus, probably on Continental Trailways Bus No. 5121,
            departing
            New Orleans at 12:20 p.m. on September 25, and scheduled to arrive
            in Houston at 10:50 p.m.; that bus is the only one on which Oswald could have left New Orleans after noon on September
            25 and arrived in Houston before midnight. Sometime in the evening he called the home
            of
            Horace Elroy Twiford, a member of the Socialist Labor Party who had received Oswald's name from the party's headquarters in New
            York and sent him a copy of its official publication, the Weekly People.
            Mrs. Twiford, who answered the telephone, believes that the call was made locally,
            before 10 p.m.
            It may have been made from Beaumont or some other stop on the route; however, in view
            of the bus
            schedule, it probably was made in Houston later than Mrs. Twiford remembered. Oswald told Mrs. Twiford that he was a member of the Fair Play
            for Cuba Committee and that he hoped to see her husband for a few hours that evening
            before he flew
            to Mexico. He wanted also to find out how Twiford had obtained his name and address.
            Mrs. Twiford
            told Oswald that her husband, a merchant seaman, was at
            sea but would be happy to see him at some other time; she offered to take a message.
            Oswald said
            that he could not await her husband's return because he was flying to Mexico. The
            Twifords
            have stated that they had no other contact with Oswald.
            An employee of the U.S. Selective Service System has stated that an individual calling
            himself
            Harvey Oswald appeared at her office in Austin, Tex., immediately after
            lunch on September 25, and discussed with her the possibility of
            rectifying his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps. Despite the employee's
            reputability and apparent sincerity, all of the information which she furnished with
            respect to
            Oswald's appearance and conversation could have
            been derived from news media, consciously or unconsciously, by the time she told the
            FBI her story.
            Other persons in Austin who, according to the employee's testimony, should also have
            observed
            Oswald failed to corroborate her testimony. No other
            evidence tending to show that Oswald was in Austin at
            this time has been discovered. The telephone call which Oswald made to the Twifords on the evening of September
            25, indicates that he was either in Houston or on his way there when he made it, since
            the
            purpose of the call was to make an appointment to see Twiford in Houston that evening.
            Oswald could not have left New Orleans on September 25, been in Austin 521 miles away by early afternoon, and
            returned 162 miles to Houston by night unless he traveled by air; airline records
            contain no
            indication that Oswald was on such flights. It is very
            unlikely that he had with him enough money beyond what he needed for the trip to Mexico
            City to
            take such flights, and the poor state of his finances at this time plus his well-established
            frugality make it extremely unlikely that he would have considered it worthwhile to
            do so even if
            he could. There is no evidence that Oswald was in such a
            hurry to reach Mexico that he would have felt it necessary to travel by airplane rather
            than a less
            expensive means of travel. He took a bus from Houston to Mexico City, lived very inexpensively
            there, and took a bus back to Dallas; there is no apparent reason why he would have
            interrupted
            such an inexpensive trip to fly to Austin and then to Houston. He told a passenger
            whom he met on
            the next leg of his trip that he had come from New Orleans, and made no reference
            to Austin. On
            September 26, Oswald
            boarded Continental Trailways bus No. 5133 in Houston and departed at 2:35 a.m. for
            Laredo, Tex.,
            via Corpus Christi and Alice. Two British tourists, Dr. and Mrs. John B. McFarland,
            who boarded No.
            5133 in Houston, noticed Oswald when they awoke at about
            6 a.m. Oswald told them that he was going to Cuba via
            Mexico City, and they inferred from conversation with him that he had left New Orleans
            early in the
            afternoon of September 25 and that he was going to Cuba via Mexico
            City. He said also that he was secretary of the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play
            for Cuba
            Committee and that he hoped to see Fidel Castro in Cuba. The bus was scheduled to
            arrive in Laredo
            at approximately 1:20 p.m. Oswald crossed the border from Laredo to Nuevo Laredo,
            Mexico, between
            1:30 and 2 p.m. From Nuevo Laredo, he traveled to Mexico City aboard bus No. 516 of
            the Flecha Roja
            Bus Line, which departed at 2:15 p.m. and was scheduled to arrive in Mexico City at
            9:45 a.m. on
            the following day; he held baggage claim check No. 320435. He was seen on the bus
            by the McFarlands
            and by two Australian girls who boarded the bus on the evening of September 26 at Monterrey. He occupied the seat next to an elderly Englishman, who told
            the girls that the young man sitting next to him apparently had been to Mexico before.
            The man next
            to Oswald was probably Albert Osborne, a native of the
            British Isles who has worked as an itinerant preacher in the Southern United States
            and Mexico for
            many years. Osborne denied that he sat beside Oswald; but in view of his inconsistent
            and untrue
            responses to Federal investigators concerning matters not directly related to Oswald,
            the
            Commission believes that his denial cannot be credited. It appeared to the other passengers
            on the
            bus that Osborne and Oswald had not previously met;
            extensive investigation has revealed no other contact between them. In the course
            of the 20-hour
            bus trip, Oswald initiated two conversations with the
            Australian girls, during which he mentioned his visit to Russia and recommended the
            Hotel Cuba in
            Mexico City as a clean and cheap" hotel; he told them, apparently falsely, that he
            had stayed there
            on previous occasions. He said that when he had seen them board the bus with their
            heavy suitcases,
            he had been under the impression that they were Mexican and had therefore asked the
            man next to him
            how to say How can I help you? in Spanish. From this they inferred that
            Oswald did not speak Spanish, an impression which is
            shared by every witness who met Oswald on his trip and
            is supported by notations which he made on documents that he carried. He got off the
            bus at every
            stop and ate large meals, always eating by himself; the girls thought he ate so much
            because he
            could not make himself understood in Spanish and had to order by pointing at the menu.
            The bus
            arrived in Mexico City 15 minutes late, at 10 a.m. Oswald left the bus station by himself and had no known further contact with any of the
            people with whom he had spoken on the bus. Oswald registered at the Hotel del Comercio
            within an
            hour of his arrival in Mexico City. He stayed there throughout his visit. The hotel,
            located not
            far from the commercial heart of the city and within four blocks of the bus station,
            is one of a
            group of hotels located near the intercity bus terminals and has perhaps the best
            appearance of the
            group. It is known by personnel in other hotels that the owner of the Hotel del Comercio
            can
            understand and speak a little English. Oswald registered
            as Lee, Harvey Oswald, and gave his occupation as photo. He had room 18 which cost $1.28 per day. After he had registered, Oswald turned promptly to the task of obtaining permission to
            enter Cuba. Mexican officials would not permit a U.S. citizen without a Cuban visa
            to board a plane
            for Cuba even if he had an American passport, but would permit passage if he had a
            visa even though
            the passport proscribed travel to Cuba. Oswald had a
            1963 American passport (stamped invalid for travel to Cuba)1154 but had
            neither a regular Cuban visa nor an intransit visa which would permit a short stay
            in Cuba on his
            way to Russia or some other country. His address book contained the telephone number
            and address of
            a Cuban airline, but there is evidence that he never visited its office. He visited
            the Cuban
            Embassy on Friday, September 27 and spoke with Senora Silvia
            Tirado de Duran, a Mexican citizen employed there. Senora Duran later made a signed
            statement to
            the Mexican police that Oswald: ... applied for a visa to Cuba in transit to Russia
            and based his
            application on his presentation of his passport in which it was recorded that, he
            had been living
            in the latter country for a period of three years, his work permit from that same
            country written
            in the Russian language and letters in the same language, as well as proof of his
            being married to
            a woman of Russian nationality and being the apparent Director in the city of New
            Orleans of the
            organization called Fair Play for Cuba with the desire that he should be
            accepted as a friend of the Cuban Revolution ... He apparently also
            stated that he was a member of the Communist Party and displayed documents which he
            claimed to be
            evidence of his membership. He said that he intended to go to Cuba on September 30 and to remain there for 2 weeks, or longer if possible, and then go on to
            Russia. Senora Duran took down the relevant date and filled out the appropriate application.
            Oswald left the Embassy but was to return in the
            afternoon. Then, or possibly even before his initial visit to the Cuban Embassy Oswald went to the Soviet Embassy where he spoke with either
            Pavel Antonovich Yatskov or Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov. They are both consular
            officials
            serving also as agents of the KGB. Oswald later said
            that he had dealt with Kostin, undoubtedly a reference to Kostikov. He
            was unable to obtain a Soviet visa then. Marina said that the officials at the Soviet
            Embassy
            refused to have anything to do with him. Oswald returned to the Cuban
            Embassy later that afternoon, this time bringing with him passport photographs which
            he may have
            obtained in the United States. Senora Duran telephoned the Soviet Embassy to inquire
            about the
            status of Oswald's Russian visa and was told that
            there would be a delay of about 4 months. Oswald became
            highly agitated and angry, particularly when he learned that he could
            not obtain an intransit visa to Cuba before he acquired a Russian visa. Senora Duran
            called the
            Cuban consul, then Eusibio Azque, to speak to him. The discussion between Oswald and Azque developed into a heated argument, which ended
            when Azque told Oswald that in his opinion people like
            Oswald were harming the Cuban Revolution and that so
            far as Azque was concerned, he would not give Oswald a
            visa. Senora Duran wrote her name and the phone number of the Embassy on a piece of
            paper which she
            gave to Oswald in case he wished to contact her again.
            He copied this information into his address book. Senora Duran forwarded the Cuban
            visa application
            to Havana ;1168 the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied on October
            15 that the visa could be issued only after Oswald had obtained a Russian visa. (See Commission Exhibit, No. 2564, p. 303.) Oswald
            contacted the Russian and Cuba Embassies again during his stay in Mexico. He had no
            greater success
            than he had before. Marina testified that when he returned to Texas, he was convinced
            that his trip
            had been a failure and disappointed at having been unable to go to Cuba. A month later,
            in a
            painstakingly composed letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Oswald ascribed his failure to a gross breach
            of regulations on the part of the Cuban Embassy. Of corse, he
            wrote, the Soviet Embassy was not at fault, they were, as I say
            unprepared. The hotel maid said that Oswald
            generally was gone by the time she arrived at 9 a.m. The night watchman said he usually
            returned at
            about midnight, which is not unusual, in view of the late hour at which Mexico City's
            evening
            activities begin. He ate several lunches at a small restaurant immediately adjacent
            to the hotel,
            coming to the restaurant shortly after 2 p.m., and ordering food by pointing to the
            menu,
            apparently with some consideration of cost; he spent between 40 and 48 cents for each
            meal. He ate
            the soup of the day, rice, and either meat or eggs, but refused dessert and coffee;
            the waitress
            concluded that Oswald did not realize that the items
            which he refused were included in the price of the lunch. He was seen with no other
            person either
            at his hotel or at the restaurant. A hotel guest stated that on one occasion he sat
            down at a table
            with Oswald because there was no empty table in the
            restaurant, but that neither spoke to the other because of the language barrier. Although
            the
            Soviet and Cuban Embassies are within two blocks of each other, they are some distance
            from Oswald's hotel. He must, therefore, have traversed a
            substantial portion of the city on more than one occasion. Marina testified that he
            told her that
            he had seen a bullfight, which would normally have been on Sunday afternoon, and that
            he had
            visited museums and done some sightseeing. He apparently also saw one or more motion
            pictures,
            either American with Spanish subtitles or Mexican with English subtitles. From notations
            in his
            Spanish-English dictionary and on his guide map of Mexico City, it appears that Oswald intended to attend a jai alai game but he almost
            certainly did not do so. He purchased several postcards depicting bullfights and tourist
            attractions, which he brought back to Marina. She had told him be- fore he left that
            she would like
            Mexican silver bracelets as a souvenir, and he brought her a silver bracelet inscribed
            with her
            name. Marina suspected, almost certainly correctly, that the bracelet, of Japanese
            origin, did not
            come from Mexico. No such jewelry is known to be sold in or around Mexico City, because
            of a high
            duty but the bracelet is of a type commonly sold in 5-and-10-cent stores in Dallas.
            Oswald did not buy the Mexican phonograph records which Marina
            had requested, despite the notation, records, which he had placed in his
            dictionary. On Monday, September 30, Oswald began to prepare for his return to the United States. He
            appeared at the Agencia de Viages, Transportes Chihuahuenses, and purchased international
            exchange
            orders costing $20.30 for travel on a Transportes del Norte bus from Mexico City to
            Laredo and by
            Greyhound bus directly from Laredo to Dallas. The travel agency made a reservation
            for him on
            Transportes del Notre bus No. 332, departing Mexico City at 8:30 a.m. on October 2. The seat, No. 12, was reserved in the name of the travel agency, which recorded
            the reservation in the name of H. O. Lee. The employee who made the
            reservation testified that he probably wrote the name that way because he was copying
            from Oswald's tourist card, which read Lee, Harvey Oswald. (The manifest for
            Transportes Frontera bus No. 340, leaving Mexico City for Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo
            at 1 p.m. on
            Wednesday, October 2, 1963, contains the name Oswld [sic], which apparently was added to the manifest after the trip; in any event,
            Oswald did not take bus 340.) On October 1, Oswald paid his hotel bill through
            that night. The hotel night watchman remembers helping Oswald obtain a taxicab at about 6:30 or 7 on the following morning. Transportes del
            Norte bus No. 332 left as scheduled at about 8:30 a.m.; at Monterrey the passengers
            were shifted to
            a relief bus, No. 373, scheduled to depart for Laredo at 10 p.m. that evening. Fellow
            passengers
            recall that Oswald was pulled off the bus by Mexican
            officials at the border, because of some alleged irregularity in his Mexican tourist
            papers; one
            passenger overheard him mumbling complaints about the Mexican immigration officials
            when he
            returned to the bus. They remember also that Oswald was
            hurriedly gulping down a banana after the bus reached customs, perhaps
            because he believed that he could not take fruit into the United States. (Marina has
            testified that
            her husband liked bananas and frequently ate them.)1201 One of the passengers testified
            that
            Oswald annoyed him by keeping his overhead light on to
            read after 10 p.m. He may have conversed with an elderly woman on the bus, but he
            was not traveling
            with her. At about 1:35 a.m. on October 3, Oswald crossed the International Bridge from Nuevo Laredo into
            Texas. He traveled from Laredo to Dallas via San Antonio, on Greyhound bus No. 1265,
            substantially
            following Interstate Route 35 for the entire trip leaving Laredo at 3 a.m. and arriving
            in Dallas
            at about 2:20 p.m. on the same day. DALLAS Oswald did not contact his
            wife immediately when he returned to Dallas. He went to the office of the employment
            commission,
            where he filed an unemployment compensation claim and announced that he was again
            looking for work.
            He spent the night at the YMCA, where he registered as a serviceman in order to avoid
            paying the
            membership fee. On the following day, he applied for a job as a typesetter trainee
            at the Padgett
            Printing Co. He made a favorable impression on the department foreman, but the plant
            superintendent
            called Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall and decided not to hire Oswald because of the unfavorable responses which his inquiries produced. Later that
            day, Oswald telephoned Marina and asked her to have Mrs.
            Paine pick him up in Dallas. Marina refused, and he hitchhiked out to the Paine home,
            where he
            spent part or all of the weekend. Marina testified that although her husband changed for the better and treated her better after his Mexican trip, she did not want to
            live with him because she was pregnant and thought it would be better to be with
            a woman who spoke English and Russian. On Monday, October 7,
            Mrs. Paine drove Oswald to the bus station, and he
            returned to Dallas to look for a job and a place to live. Oswald thought that the
            YMCA was too
            expensive for him, and intended to rent a room. He inquired about a room at 1026 North Beckley, where he lived later, but on October 7 there were no vacancies. He next responded to a For Rent sign at a rooming house at 621
            Marsalis Street. He obtained a room, for which he paid the weekly rent of $7 in advance,
            and moved in on the same day. He immediately resumed his job-hunting, relying partially
            on
            referrals by the employment commission. He spent much of the time when he was not
            looking for work
            in his room. He telephoned his wife daily. She wrote: Lee called twice a day, was
            worried about my health and about June. On
            Friday, Oswald told his landlady, Mrs. Mary Bledsoe,
            that he was going to Irving for the weekend but would return the following week. She
            refused to
            rent the room to him for another week because she didn't like him. Oswald spent the
            weekend of
            October 12-13 at Mrs. Paine's home, during which time she
            gave him a driving lesson. He told her that he had received the last of the unemployment
            checks due
            him, and that it had been smaller than the previous ones. Mrs. Paine testified that
            Oswald was extremely discouraged because his wife was expecting
            a baby, he had no job prospects in sight, and he no longer had any source of income.
            On Monday,
            Mrs. Paine drove Oswald into Dallas, since she had other
            business there. He picked up his bag from Mrs. Bledsoe's roominghouse and later that
            day
            rented a room at 1026 North Beckley Avenue from
            Mrs. A. C. Johnson for $8 a week. He registered as O. H.
            Lee and moved in immediately. Oswald felt that
            this room was more comfortable than the previous one, particularly because he had
            television and
            refrigerator privileges. He apparently continued to spend most of his evenings in
            his room. He
            borrowed books from the library and had subscriptions to various periodicals, including
            Time, the
            Worker, the Militant, and some Russian periodicals. On that Monday, Mrs. Paine mentioned
            the Oswalds' financial and employment problems
            to neighbors whom she was visiting. Mrs. Linnie Mac Randle, who was also present,
            remarked that she
            thought that her younger brother, Buell Wesley Frazier, who worked at the Texas School
            Book
            Depository, had said that there was a job opening there. When Marina heard of this,
            she asked Mrs.
            Paine to call the Depository to see if there was an opening. Mrs. Paine called Roy
            S. Truly,
            superintendent of the Depository, who indicated that he would talk to Oswald if he would apply in person. When Oswald telephoned the Paine house on Monday evening, Mrs. Paine
            told him about this possibility. On the next day, Oswald
            was interviewed by Truly and hired in a temporary capacity. He began work on Wednesday,
            October 16. His duties were to fill book orders; his hours were 8 a.m. to
            4:45 p.m., for which he received $1.25 an hour. Both the Oswalds were elated with the new job, although it apparently required little skill
            or experience and he indicated that he still hoped to obtain a better job. He did
            a satisfactory
            job at the Depository, but he kept to himself and very few of his fellow employees
            got to know him.
            During his first week at work, Oswald became acquainted
            with Frazier, with whom he arranged to ride to Irving on weekends. On Friday, October 18, Frazier drove him from work to the Paine home; since it was
            his birthday, Marina and Ruth Paine had arranged a small celebration. On Sunday, he
            stayed with
            June and the Paine children, while Mrs. Paine drove
            Marina to Parkland Hospital where she gave birth to a second daughter, Rachel. He
            went to work on
            Monday, but that evening visited Marina in the hospital and spent the night in Irving.
            Marina
            wrote: Monday evening Lee visited me in the hospital. He
            was very happy at the birth of another daughter and even wept a little. He said that
            two daughters
            were better for each other--two sisters. He stayed with me about two hours. Oswald
            returned to
            Dallas the next morning. Oswald wrote to Arnold Johnson of the Communist Party, U.S.A., that on the evening of October 23, he had attended an ultra right
            meeting headed by Gen. Edwin A. Walker. Two evenings later, he accompanied Michael
            Paine to a
            meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union, held at Southern Methodist University.
            At this
            meeting, a statement was made to the effect that members of the John Birch Society
            should not be
            considered anti-Semitic; Oswald rose and stated that at
            the meeting which he had attended 2 days earlier, he had heard a number of anti-Semitic
            and
            anti-Catholic statements. Later in the evening, Oswald
            became involved in a discussion with several people, including Frank Krystinik, who
            was employed
            with Paine at the Bell Helicopter plant. During this conversation, Oswald expressed Marxist views and declared that he was a
            Marxist, although denying that he was a Communist. He admitted that the United States
            was superior
            to the Soviet Union in the area of civil liberties and praised President Kennedy for
            his work in
            that connection. Krystinik testified that he got the impression that Oswald did not fully understand the views he was expounding.
            Throughout that week Oswald telephoned his wife to
            inquire about her health and that of the baby. He spent the weekend at the Paine home,
            to which
            Marina and Rachel had returned during the week. On Friday, November
            1, he obtained post office box No. 6225 at the Terminal Annex Post Office Station. He
            indicated that the box would also be used to receive mail for the Fair Play for Cuba
            Committee and
            the American Civil Liberties Union. Once again he spent the weekend in Irving. Throughout
            this
            period, the FBI had been aware of the whereabouts of the Oswalds. There was a record in the Dallas office of the FBI that Oswald subscribed to the Worker, engaged in Fair Play for Cuba
            Committee activities and had traveled to Mexico. An FBI agent visited the Paine home
            on November
            and, accompanied by another agent, again on November 5, and spoke
            briefly with Mrs. Paine. On neither occasion was Oswald
            present. Ruth Paine noted the agent's name and telephone number and, in accordance
            with her
            husband's instructions, Marina noted the license number of the agent's automobile,
            all of
            which was subsequently reported to Oswald. Both Mrs.
            Paine and Marina testified that Oswald was troubled by
            the FBI's interest in him. He declared that the FBI was trying to
            inhibit his activities, and wrote the Soviet Embassy in Washington: The Federal Bureu of
            Investigation is not now interested in my activities in the progressive organization
            Fair Play for Cuba Committee of which I was secretary in New Orleans (state
            Louisiana) since I no longer reside in that state. However, the F.B.I. has visted
            us here in
            Dallas, Texas, on November 1st. Agent James P. Hasty warned me that
            if I engaged in F.P.C.C. activities in Texas the F.B.I. will again take an interest in me. This agent also 'suggested' to Marina Nichilayeva that she
            could remain in the United States under F.B.I. 'protection', that is, she could defect
            from the Soviet Union, of couse, I and my wife strongly protested these tactics by
            the notorious
            F.B.I. Please inform us of the arrival of our Soviet entrance visa's as soon as they
            come.
            (See Commission Exhibit 15, p. 311.) Marina testified that the statements, both by
            and to the FBI
            agents, to which her husband referred in this letter, were in fact never made. The
            following
            Friday, November 8, Oswald as usual drove to the Paine house with Frazier. On Saturday Mrs. Paine took him
            to the Texas Drivers' License Examining Station, but because it was an election day
            the
            station was closed. Oswald stayed at the Paines through
            Monday, November 11, which was Veterans Day. During the weekend,
            Mrs. Paine gave Oswald a second driving lesson. Oswald
            did not go to Irving on the next weekend. His wife had asked him not to come because
            Michael Paine,
            with whom Oswald did not get along, would be there to
            celebrate his daughter's birthday. Also, she felt that because he had stayed for 3
            days the
            preceding weekend, he would abuse Mrs. Paine's hospitality if he returned so soon.
            Oswald telephoned Marina on Saturday afternoon and said that he
            had returned to the drivers' license examining station that morning but had not waited
            because
            there was a long line. On Sunday, November 17, at Marina's
            request, Ruth Paine telephoned Oswald at the Beckley
            Avenue number, which he had given to Marina. When she asked for him, she was told
            that no one by
            that name lived at the address, which greatly surprised her. On the next day, Oswald telephoned his wife. When she indicated that she had
            been upset by the fact that there had been no Lee Oswald
            at the number which she had asked Mrs. Paine to call Oswald became angry; he said that he was using a fictitious name and that she should not
            have called the Beckley Avenue number. He did not telephone on the following day,
            which was
            unusual. On the morning of Thursday, November 21, Oswald asked Frazier to take him to Irving when he went home
            that evening, saying that he wanted to pick up some curtain rods. His arrival was
            a surprise
            because he generally asked Mrs. Paine's permission before arriving for a visit. The
            women
            thought that he had come to Irving because he felt badly about arguing with his wife
            about the use
            of the fictitious name. He said that he was lonely, because he had not come the preceding
            weekend,
            and told Marina that he wanted to make his peace with her. He spent the
            time before dinner on the lawn playing with his daughter. However, when he attempted
            to talk to his
            wife she would not answer, which upset him. He asked her to live with him in Dallas,
            and she
            refused. After supper, Oswald watched television while
            the women cleaned the house and prepared their children for bed. He retired early
            in the evening at
            about 9. </main>

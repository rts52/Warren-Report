PAGES
Step 1a. use ^[page]+ [0-9]+ to find all the page numbers 
1b. used replace <page pageNumber="\0">\0</page>, can probably be done more efficiently to avoid step 1c
1c. find "[page]+  and replace with " (there is a space after the + here)
!!make sure to add page elements to the schema!!

TIMES
Step 2a. use [0-9]+:[0-9]+ [(ap)]\.m\ and  [0-9]+ [(ap)]\.m\. to locate all times in chapter 5
2b. Wrap using <time>\0</time> (could potentially add an attribute later) 

PEOPLE
Step 3a. Locate all persons of interest: key people: Oswald, President Kennedy,
3b. For Oswald, use Oswald['s]* to locate but also find lee harvey (to which there are 5 in this specific chapter), I wrapped using <person perid="oswald">\0</person> then manually added Lee Harvey into the 5 sections where the full name was mentioned (I opted to go manual markup here because of how little it was mentioned) 
3c. For Kennedy, he shows up as either President Kennedy, just Kennedy

TEXT
Step 4a. search \n\n then replace with </text>\n<text>\0
4b. Manually add <text> to the top line and </text> to the bottom line
UNNESSARY INFO
use \nReturn to top\n and replace with nothing to remove all the remove to tops in the chapter

ALL THE CHANGES I MADE:

- In general root has been changed to wrstart, no particular reason for this.

CHAPTER 7:
- Changed all the elements so that they are all lowercase to account for the schema
- There is one discussion element outside of page elements, so I changed it to <starter> to avoid overlaps
- About halfway through the XML, discussion elements were made outside of the page elements whereas before they were 
inside the page elements. !!I DID NOT CHANGE THIS YET AS I DON'T KNOW HOW TO!!
-changed <text> to <texts>


CHAPTER 5:
- This one is planned to reworked from the ground up so don't account for it just yet
